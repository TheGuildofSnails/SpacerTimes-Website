NARRATOR
Twelve men sit in a burned down ballroom. Their backs are straight with dead silence hanging about. The man's eyes darted to one another fearful for what’s to happen. A couple of them shaking slightly, though they try to hide it. Others are sweating, letting the droplets hit their eyes terrified for what would happen if they wiped their foreheads. 

NARRATOR
Charred doors were kicked open by freshly shined steel toed boots. Grand commander Shire stood in the doorway, looking at the men with piercing anger. 

SHIRE
[in a calm tone]
I’ll ask once. 
Who?... Who? Shot the woman?

NARRATOR
Silence stood in the room. Shire covered his face in shame.

SHIRE
Okay that's fine.

NARRATOR
He walked up to Squire Dans. Making sure to have his steel toe boots hit the iron nails in the floorboards. The reverb of the boots made the men flinch in every hit. 

SHIRE
You! Dans, do you know who shot the woman?

DANS
No, Sir!

SHIRE
[whisper to Dans]
Alright, that's fine. Do you know who knows Dans?
 
DANS
No, sir!

SHIRE
THEN WHY ARE YOU STANDING HERE?!

NARRATOR
Dans cowarded before straightening out once more. 

DANS
I-I don’t know sir.

NARRATOR
Shire raised his hand in surprise before spinning around to Dans. 

SHIRE
I have a question for you, Dans.

DANS
Yes sir.

SHIRE
Who am I to shoot?

DANS
[shocked]
What?

SHIRE
[mockingly]
What..what?

NARRATOR
Now Shire was so close to Dan's face he could see the sweat on his face. 

DANS
What did you mean by your request sir?

NARRATOR
Shire backed away from Dans, making sure to keep eye contact. 

SHIRE
What did you think I mean?

DANS
I truly don’t know sir, I just wish to understand to fulfill my o-

SHIRE
WHAT DO YOU THINK I MEAN SQUIRE?

DANS
Sorry sir, I-I I think you mean you want to shoot someone.

SHIRE
And?

DANS
And that you wanted me to choose that person, sir. 

SHIRE
Good, really good. Now do you have someone for me to shoot?

DANS
Sir, may I ask why you want me to choose?

SHIRE
No you may not, Dans. It should be clear one of you shot a woman. Now you don’t know who it was, yes?

DANS
Yes sir.

SHIRE
Then logically we must assume one of your fellow squires, that you do not know; did shoot a woman, yes?

DANS
[less assured]
Yes sir.

SHIRE
Then if we do not know who did, and as it seems you and your squad decided to all take the fall for it, I am simply letting you have that wish. Now I want a name.

DANS
[without hesitation]
Dans Sir Dans Harken.

NARRATOR
Shire looked him up and down before giving a quick laugh. 

SHIRE
No..!, I’m afraid it can’t be you. Let's make it more interesting. If you don't tell me a name; I’ll make sure your family gets put back into level eight.

DANS
[lightly gasps]

SHIRE
Your sister will be taken from her wonderful husband and put in the pleasure house, father goes to the mines, mom gets married off to some dried up bureaucrat. And just for fun, how about you get to be on uranium duty? Now THAT can happen or you can give me a name of someone for myself to shoot?

NARRATOR
Dans took a second to think. 

DANS
Sir, is there any other discipline we could absorb as a group? I don’t wish to question you, but I don’t wish to have one of my own be killed.

SHIRE
No I’m afraid not Dans, While I respect your willingness to your own I can't help but feel bouts of disrespect from the question.

DANS
Sorry sir, I hope my loyalness is still apparent to you. I just wish for a moment to choose.

SHIRE
Of course Dans take all the time you need.

DANS
Thank you sir.

NARRATOR
The room was robbed of words. Some of the men tried to show their willingness to take the punishment by looking at Dans. They soften their eyes to make the choice easier. The rest of the men averted their eyes from Dans.  Some even silently weeping to silently beg for their lives. 


NARRATOR
Dans wasn’t looking at any of the squad, instead he kept making eye contact with Grand Commander Shire. His face showed only a despair, a despair he wished for Grand Commander Shire to remember.

DANS
[whispered]
Niles.

SHIRE
What was that? 

DANS
[slightly louder]
I said Niles sir.

SHIRE
I ask Squire Dans that you raise your voice a bit more for the rest of the squad to hear.

DANS
I SAID SQUIRE NILES, SIR

NARRATOR
Niles toughened his face.

SHIRE
GOOD, now I just ask that you watch.

NARRATOR
Dans nodded, he turned his head to Niles. If he was to cause his death Dans was to watch to give him that little honor. 

NARRATOR
Shire took his time getting to Niles, making sure to look at each and every squad member. 

NARRATOR
Bang… Bang… Bang… The hollow room made sure everyone heard his impending doom. Niles held a strong face still not letting his true fear show. 

NARRATOR
Shire stopped in his footsteps when heard a mumble. 


WINSLOW
I-it was me sir, I shot the woman.

NARRATOR
Shire stopped at Niles before turning to Winslow. 

SHIRE
Good, I hope explaining to Squire Nile’s parents why he’s dead will help you not do it again.

NARRATOR
BAM! Niles dropped to the ground in a slump. The squad looked in horror, the men that were crying began to sob. 

SHIRE
Now Squire Winslow. I ask that you bury the late Squires Niles. And then in detail too. Tell his parents why and I do mean exactly why Niles had to die. If I feel your promptly made report isn’t perfect I will ask you to explain AGAIN why their son had to die. THEN and only then I will believe punishment is made.  Now If you will let me go I have a very busy day.

NARRATOR
Shire walked to the doorway before stopping. 

SHIRE
I forgot, Dans don’t feel too bad about this fact. Personally I’m not going too. But I thought you might want to know that Niles' wife learned this morning that she is to have a son. We allocated money for her to have a party. I will have to put that money back in the party fund since she won't be needing it. That is all.

NARRATOR
Shire’s boots sounded off before there was once again silence.

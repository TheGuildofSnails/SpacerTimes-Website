# A readers story - Station
##### Wrote by Ethan Skinner

**ANN:** [giddy] It’s today isn’t it? 

**JAMES:** [monotone] I believe so. 

**NARRATOR:** The quiet darkness of space didn’t allow for any hope of excitement. A life long dream dragged by day by day routine. Flavorless food, boring schedules that planned days down to the second. Despite daily disappointments, today was special. Today was refill day.  \
[long pause] \
Today two pieces of steak with four ounces of steak sauce made its way to James and Ann. As the self guided refill rocket entered the dock, Ann and James gave a little smile. Their stomachs grumbling, today was a good day.

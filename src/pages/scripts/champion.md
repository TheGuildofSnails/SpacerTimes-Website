# Champion

**QUINTIN:**
What loss? 

**KARA:**
I never said loss, I just said it felt like a loss. 

**QUINTIN:**
Is this is your fight with Ferra? 

**KARA:**
Any fight really, there's a ticker in my head telling me I’m that much closer to retirement. 

**QUINTIN:**
And what's scary about retirement? 

**KARA:**
What’s not? I’m shoved to the side for someone new and frankley better than me. They get to fight longer thanks to new knowledge. We’ll learn that wearing polyester tops versus cotton tops means I’m gonna get some rare cancer. A cancer of course they can’t cure. Then that’s it for me, poof nothing but dust right? 

**QUINTIN:**
And why are you so unlucky, is it religious or biology? 

**KARA:**
You tell me, I mean I never thought of that, I just know it's real.

**QUINTIN:**
So it sounds like you fear not being known, what makes fame so important to you? 

**KARA:**
I’m sorry, how does that relate to being unlucky? 

**QUINTIN:**
Well bad things happen to famous people all the time right? And some could say their lifestyles encourage bad things to happen. So are you unlucky because you are famous?  

**KARA:**
No, these things would happen no matter what. I can’t tell you how many sudden illnesses or flat tires have hindered my fights? Not to mention my mothers side can’t build muscle.  I work three times as hard and get half the results, that's the phrase right? I’m not ungrateful but I’m simply cursed.

**QUINTIN:**
If you weren't ‘cursed’ how much more important would you be in boxing? 

**KARA:**
A lot more I think. If I fought Verna I’d be the first of the decade to beat the unbeatable. And I guess fighting Tonya would have made me known for being a heavy striker. 

**QUINTIN:**
Correct me if I’m wrong but aren't you known to be a heavy striker now?

**KARA:**
So? 

**QUINTIN:**
Well could it be that you're mad at yourself? I’m not saying you're not a realist, quite the contrary. But could it be that you are mad at not being the best in your field? 

**KARA:**
Like I’m putting the blame on something else? 

**QUINTIN:**
Yep, you're putting such high standards on yourself. What are you gonna do when you lose boxing as an outlet, a lifestyle? 

**KARA:**
I’m going to coach young girls in bad neighborhoods. Give them something to live for, you know? 

**QUINTIN:**
See, you're more than a fighter Kara. I’m not asking you to be some stoic and let the world pass you. But you need to start thinking about your future. It will happen Kara, and one day you will die, so think about it now. 

**KARA:**
And you, when you die what will be your last thoughts? 

**QUINTIN:**
I hope it's being satisfied with my work, but it will probably be about how much pain I’m in if we’re being honest. 

**KARA:**
It sounds like we’re both unlucky.

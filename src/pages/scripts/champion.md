Quintin
What loss? 

Kara
I never said loss, I just said it felt like a loss. 

Quintin
Is this is your fight with Ferra? 

Kara
Any fight really, there's a ticker in my head telling me I’m that much closer to retirement. 

Quintin
And what's scary about retirement? 

Kara
What’s not? I’m shoved to the side for someone new and frankley better than me. They get to fight longer thanks to new knowledge. We’ll learn that wearing polyester tops versus cotton tops means I’m gonna get some rare cancer. A cancer of course they can’t cure. Then that’s it for me, poof nothing but dust right? 

Quintin
And why are you so unlucky, is it religious or biology? 

Kara
You tell me, I mean I never thought of that, I just know it's real.

Quintin
So it sounds like you fear not being known, what makes fame so important to you? 

Kara
I’m sorry, how does that relate to being unlucky? 

Quintin
Well bad things happen to famous people all the time right? And some could say their lifestyles encourage bad things to happen. So are you unlucky because you are famous?  



Kara
No, these things would happen no matter what. I can’t tell you how many sudden illnesses or flat tires have hindered my fights? Not to mention my mothers side can’t build muscle.  I work three times as hard and get half the results, that's the phrase right? I’m not ungrateful but I’m simply cursed.

Quintin
If you weren't ‘cursed’ how much more important would you be in boxing? 

Kara
A lot more I think. If I fought Verna I’d be the first of the decade to beat the unbeatable. And I guess fighting Tonya would have made me known for being a heavy striker. 

Quintin
Correct me if I’m wrong but aren't you known to be a heavy striker now?

Kara
So? 

Quintin
Well could it be that you're mad at yourself? I’m not saying you're not a realist, quite the contrary. But could it be that you are mad at not being the best in your field? 

Kara
Like I’m putting the blame on something else? 

Quintin
Yep, you're putting such high standards on yourself. What are you gonna do when you lose boxing as an outlet, a lifestyle? 

Kara
I’m going to coach young girls in bad neighborhoods. Give them something to live for, you know? 

Quintin
See, you're more than a fighter Kara. I’m not asking you to be some stoic and let the world pass you. But you need to start thinking about your future. It will happen Kara, and one day you will die, so think about it now. 


Kara
And you, when you die what will be your last thoughts? 

Quintin
I hope it's being satisfied with my work, but it will probably be about how much pain I’m in if we’re being honest. 

Kara
It sounds like we’re both unlucky.

Gaina
What was the passcode?

Francis
Don’t you have it written down?

Gaina
Clearly not, now, the code please?

Francis
You know you should consider taking that cinnamon supplement I was talking about earlier. It would help you stop forgetting stuff so easily.. 

Gaina
Thanks, the code please.

Francis
Kind of hurtful. Nine, four, three, two.

Gaina
If you didn’t turn everything into a sales pitch I’d listen more.

Francis
Could of told me that in a less hurtful way, you know. 

Gaina
Later. Francis, here put on your Cephalo now before we lose breathing privileges.

Narrator
Francis and Gaina wrapped the Cephalo around their faces. A new age squid that was modified to allow humans to breathe in near zero oxygen conditions. 

Francis
You know I hate seafood?

Narrator
Gaina stopped for a second. She gave a quick chuckle before putting her Cephalo on her face. 

Gaina
Four point five. 

Francis
I’ll take it.

Gaina
I didn’t say out of how much.

Francis
You didn’t need to.

Narrator
The oxygen was sucked out of the room. Within less than five minutes the room went from breathable for any living mammal to not being able to support a fly.  

Narrator
With them depending now on their Cephalo’s, steps were taken carefully as to not over stress them. Using heated salt water to keep their pores from freezing or tensing. Likewise, Francis and Gaina put on their cold suits in preparation for the freezing tunnel. Its mile-long tunnel is immensely cold. 

Gaina
Okay, let's get us some credits.

Narrator
They began the mile long walk. With tens of gallons of water strapped onto their hips. Weighing them down making the tread slowly

Francis
Were you shocked that the Args didn’t think of the squids? The smartest people in the universe right?

Gaina
Well you know, they probably assumed most people would use metal tanks or try to bribe one of their own.

Francis
Yeah right, we’re barely making a profit as is. Imagine having to bribe someone, might as well work at the bank.

Gaina
Well I think we forget that these people don’t realize how hard it is to deter our type. 

Francis
Which are?. 

Gaina
The desperate.

Francis
Ah the hardest group to handle as well as get rid of.

Gaina
Well maybe so but the squid have been used for centuries. Your telling me no one's thought of it?

Francis
Well yeah I guess. Maybe in their cleanliness they’re stuck with zero air chambers and their silly magnets.

Narrator
They stopped to pour water on their Cephalos. 

Francis
So what are we doing after this? I mean we can do so many heists before we get killed or caught.

Gaina
Are we getting cold feet?

Francis
No, it's just a thought of how this all ends. I think we’re lucky enough to get as far as we have. And eventually it has to end, right?

Gaina
Who said it had to end? We’re easily the most careful team out there, we live modestly, and we keep contact light. How many teams do the same?

Francis
Well that may be true but don’t you want a life at some point? No more running y’know?

Gaina
This is our life. What do you want to be a farmer? A hoaky guy that’s tied down.

Francis
I never said that, I want peace, I don’t want to worry if a bounty hunter or an op is coming for me!

Gaina
Where’s the purpose in peace? Those immortal zombies have all the peace in the universe and look at them. They just live their lives without doing anything with it!

Francis
That may be true but life shouldn’t be so intense. I shouldn’t wonder if todays the day I get shot by a guard. And really what if I want to die happy and old? Is that so terrible?

Gaina
Yes you're meant to be more than a piece of equipment, safety is a lie.

Francis
Very people conscience I see.

Gaina
No, not people's conscience, we are meant to be free. This is life okay? Not out there, here.

Francis
How about we talk about it on the ship? We got a job to do.

Gaina
Yeah.

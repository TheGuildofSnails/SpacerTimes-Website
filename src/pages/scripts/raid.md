# Raid

**GAINA:**
What was the passcode?

**FRANCIS:**
Don’t you have it written down?

**GAINA:**
Clearly not, now, the code please?

**FRANCIS:**
You know you should consider taking that cinnamon supplement I was talking about earlier. It would help you stop forgetting stuff so easily.. 

**GAINA:**
Thanks, the code please.

**FRANCIS:**
Kind of hurtful. Nine, four, three, two.

**GAINA:**
If you didn’t turn everything into a sales pitch I’d listen more.

**FRANCIS:**
Could of told me that in a less hurtful way, you know. 

**GAINA:**
Later. Francis, here put on your Cephalo now before we lose breathing privileges.

**NARRATOR:**
Francis and Gaina wrapped the Cephalo around their faces. A new age squid that was modified to allow humans to breathe in near zero oxygen conditions. 

**FRANCIS:**
You know I hate seafood?

**NARRATOR:**
Gaina stopped for a second. She gave a quick chuckle before putting her Cephalo on her face. 

**GAINA:**
Four point five. 

**FRANCIS:**
I’ll take it.

**GAINA:**
I didn’t say out of how much.

**FRANCIS:**
You didn’t need to.

**NARRATOR:**
The oxygen was sucked out of the room. Within less than five minutes the room went from breathable for any living mammal to not being able to support a fly.  

**NARRATOR:**
With them depending now on their Cephalo’s, steps were taken carefully as to not over stress them. Using heated salt water to keep their pores from freezing or tensing. Likewise, Francis and Gaina put on their cold suits in preparation for the freezing tunnel. Its mile-long tunnel is immensely cold. 

**GAINA:**
Okay, let's get us some credits.

**NARRATOR:**
They began the mile long walk. With tens of gallons of water strapped onto their hips. Weighing them down making the tread slowly

**FRANCIS:**
Were you shocked that the Args didn’t think of the squids? The smartest people in the universe right?

**GAINA:**
Well you know, they probably assumed most people would use metal tanks or try to bribe one of their own.

**FRANCIS:**
Yeah right, we’re barely making a profit as is. Imagine having to bribe someone, might as well work at the bank.

**GAINA:**
Well I think we forget that these people don’t realize how hard it is to deter our type. 

**FRANCIS:**
Which are?. 

**GAINA:**
The desperate.

**FRANCIS:**
Ah the hardest group to handle as well as get rid of.

**GAINA:**
Well maybe so but the squid have been used for centuries. Your telling me no one's thought of it?

**FRANCIS:**
Well yeah I guess. Maybe in their cleanliness they’re stuck with zero air chambers and their silly magnets.

**NARRATOR:**
They stopped to pour water on their Cephalos. 

**FRANCIS:**
So what are we doing after this? I mean we can do so many heists before we get killed or caught.

**GAINA:**
Are we getting cold feet?

**FRANCIS:**
No, it's just a thought of how this all ends. I think we’re lucky enough to get as far as we have. And eventually it has to end, right?

**GAINA:**
Who said it had to end? We’re easily the most careful team out there, we live modestly, and we keep contact light. How many teams do the same?

**FRANCIS:**
Well that may be true but don’t you want a life at some point? No more running y’know?

**GAINA:**
This is our life. What do you want to be a farmer? A hoaky guy that’s tied down.

**FRANCIS:**
I never said that, I want peace, I don’t want to worry if a bounty hunter or an op is coming for me!

**GAINA:**
Where’s the purpose in peace? Those immortal zombies have all the peace in the universe and look at them. They just live their lives without doing anything with it!

**FRANCIS:**
That may be true but life shouldn’t be so intense. I shouldn’t wonder if todays the day I get shot by a guard. And really what if I want to die happy and old? Is that so terrible?

**GAINA:**
Yes you're meant to be more than a piece of equipment, safety is a lie.

**FRANCIS:**
Very people conscience I see.

**GAINA:**
No, not people's conscience, we are meant to be free. This is life okay? Not out there, here.

**FRANCIS:**
How about we talk about it on the ship? We got a job to do.

**GAINA:**
Yeah.

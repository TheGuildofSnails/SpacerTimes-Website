# Circus: Walstein

**WALSTEIN:** [whispered to self] Even the devil is smart enough to be seen as honorable.

**MON:** What’s that Walstein?

**WALSTEIN:** Nothing.

**MON:** Good, get the team together.

**WALSTEIN:** Do you ever get tired?

**MON:** What?

**WALSTEIN:** Of revenge.

**MON:** [smiling] Get the team, okay?

**NARRATOR:** The hybrid men sat on top of the roof in their broken uniforms. Their guns were older than most men there, and jammed so often that they were more useful as clubs. Still, the animal men looked terrifying, especially to the children that also sat with them on the roof. Walstein dusted off his uniform with his eagle claw before beginning his speech…

**WALSTEIN:** Good people of the new hybrid republic. I stand before you a broken man. These lands have stolen us! Turned us into beasts, and mocked our existence! As animals- we became animals! All I ask of these children that sit before us, scared and hurt. I ask you! I ask you to understand that your parents have put this sin upon you. A sin that can be cleaned if they are willing to give up our oppressors.

**NARRATOR:** A group of adults sat tied down on the roof. One by one gags were released from their mouths but they didn’t dare speak. 

**WALSTEIN:** Now we will allow the freedom of you and your children if you cooperate. Despite your actions, we do not wish to inflict the same upon your own. So please do cooperate. 

**NARRATOR:** Two soldiers went around with photos showing them to the parents. Some struggled to walk around with their elephant feet crudely attached to their hips. Others struggled to hold the pictures up with their broken joints replaced with the legs of a giraffe. Still, they dutifully held it to the crowd. A man eventually yelled out the name with a tinge of fear. 

**WALSTEIN:** You sir? What do you know?

**THE MAN:** He’s hiding d-down in the Abar train station. I-if you let my girl go I’ll help you find him.

**WALSTEIN:** Good! One of you will go with our friend here and take the girl, okay?

**NARRATOR:** A soldier cut the man's ties. [sfx. Ropes cut] He ran to his child sobbing. Weakly he got up thanking the hybrid soldiers tightly holding on to her hand. From the crowd, a man yelled.

**TOMLIN:** [shouting] Traitor! 

**WALSTEIN:** [yelling] Who said that! 

**NARRATOR:** The Crowd got quiet once more. Walstein picked up a child no older than three dangling him over the roof. The child began to give out a wail. [sfx. Child screams?]

**WALSTEIN:** [yelling] If I do not get an answer I’m dropping every single one of these children!

**NARRATOR:** The crowd stood silent. No one made a sound until a man answered.

**TOMLIN:** It was me!

**WALSTEIN:** You sir, why did you scream _traitor_? 

**TOMLIN:** [shouting] I’m sorry sir! I never meant to offend you!

**WALSTEIN:** You meant to offend your friend then?

**TOMLIN:** [shouting] No sir!

**WALSTEIN:** Then who did you mean to offend?

**TOMLIN:** [shouting] I don’t know sir!

**WALSTEIN:** What's your name?

**TOMLIN:** Tomlin Sir!

**WALSTEIN:** Tomlin, you are _very_ stupid.

**TOMLIN:** I know...

**WALSTEIN: _Good_**. Since you felt the need to show me that aspect of yourself I will give you a choice. I will drop this child unless you give up one of your own. I need it to be someone _close_, someone you love dearly. I want you to know we will torture this person _every. single. day._ They will never see the sun, they will never see peace again. We will peel the skin from their bones, rip out their fingernails, and we will wait for them to grow back to do it _again_. We will drip molten iron on their skin. We will make sure they carry your mistake for the rest of their life. So _where_ is this individual you love so dearly, that you would _betray_ so heartlessly?

**TOMLIN:** I-i can’t do that, I can't!

**WALSTEIN:** So am I free to drop this child?

**TOMLIN:** No!

**WALSTEIN:** Then I need a name.

**TOMLIN:** C-can I have a moment?

**WALSTEIN:** Be quick, my arm is getting tired.

**NARRATOR:** The man’s face was covered in sweat. And in shame, he kept his eyes on the floor. The boy’s crying washed over the crowd further increasing his shame. [sfx. Child screams?]

**TOMLIN:** Dara Rilins.

**WALSTEIN:** Who is that to you? A wife, a sister?

**TOMLIN:** A wife.

**WALSTEIN:** [quick] No it's not. There wasn’t enough _pain_ in your voice.

**NARRATOR:** Walstien let go of the boy's left arm. He dangled weakly, grabbing at Walstien’s eagle claw. His wails getting louder. [sfx. Child screams louder?]

**WALSTEIN:** I’m giving you one more chance.

**TOMLIN:** Wait, wait! Okay, I have a name.

**WALSTEIN:** [scornful] It’s about time.

**NARRATOR:** Tomlin took a moment to look around at the other nonhybrids. All afraid to look back at him. With a small sigh, he gave out.

**TOMLIN:** _*sigh*_ Ann Vin.

**NARRATOR:** Walstein looked back at Tomlin. 

**WALSTEIN:** [cheery] Good…

**NARRATOR:** He put the child back into the crowd of children. Walking back to his observation post. 

**WALSTEIN:** Go ahead and follow one of my friends here, Mr.Tomlin. Go betray your own. 

**NARRATOR:** Tomlin’s binds were cut. [sfx. Rope cut] He shuffled away from the crowd in a hunch as he was unable to stand in pride ever again. 

**MON:** [lean in and whisper] Even the devil is smart enough to be seen as honorable.

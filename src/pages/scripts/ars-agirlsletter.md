# A readers story - A Girls Letter
##### Wrote by Ethan Skinner

**NARRATOR:** _Dear_ mother, I sit among the dead. In a short time I will have to do the worst thing a child can do to their parents. This _war_ will not end until people like me are _foolish_ enough to do the worst thing a child can do. I am _scared_, I am mad, I am mournful, and most of all. Please do not _hate_ me. Do not _hate_ my commander or even our enemies. The course of history _stole_ me, that long line of blood shed hungry. I _love_ you mother.

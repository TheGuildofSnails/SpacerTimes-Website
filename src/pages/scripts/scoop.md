# Scoop

**NARRATOR:**
The Hotel room was moldy and small. Hollus could barely use the little dinner table to clean his gun.

**HOLLUS:**
What are you writing? We’re five hours away from the damn thing. 

**THATCHER:**
I’m a hostage right? I should have a story written to prove I was working. 

**HOLLUS:**
I’m no computer guy but I’m pretty sure your computer will tell on you. 

**THATCHER:**
That's where you change the time and take it off wifi. Stick with wife killing I’ll stick with computers. 

**HOLLUS:**
I’m just saying that’s all. You bring any good food with you? I’m getting a bit hungry. 

**THATCHER:**
Yeah I got Ramen from the vending machine outside. I figured your last meal should include some MSG.  

**HOLLUS:**
That's awfully kind of you. 

**THATCHER:**
Southern manners. You want that now? Give’s me something to do besides look at my screen.  

**HOLLUS:**
Yeah I guess, did you get any seasonings for it?

**THATCHER:**
Uh, they got some salt and pepper. 

**HOLLUS:**
Could I get some pepper for that?

**THATCHER:**
Of course, you’re a kidnapper and a connoisseur. 

**NARRATOR:**
Thatcher took out his mini stove and began to cook.

**HOLLUS:**
You really don’t have an issue with this? I mean I know you're a journalist but still. 

**THATCHER:**
Yeah I mean I’m not big on you killing your wife, but you're gonna do it no matter what right? 

**HOLLUS:**
Yep.

**THATCHER:**
See! So what’s the hurt in tagging along? 

**HOLLUS:**
I could see that. You have to admit though it’s a strange mentality. 

**THATCHER:**
As much as killing your wife is I imagine. 

**HOLLUS:**
You're watching the whole thing, getting rich off it. How removed are you from me in that case. Hell! You're making my final meal.  

**THATCHER:**
Maybe being moral beings isn’t our best strong suit. Now eating I can agree with you on. 

**NARRATOR:**
Hollus cleared his table for his Ramen. 

**HOLLUS:**
What’s the plan? 

**THATCHER:**
For what? 

**HOLLUS:**
After I’m dead. 

**THATCHER:**
Well probably after my lengthy press tour, a multi million dollar netflix deal, and tie in book deal. Politics. I could make a decent senator. 

**HOLLUS:**
You got the moral compass of one. What’s the story for your wife? You're gonna tell her the truth? 

**THATCHER:**
No, I love her too much to do that

**HOLLUS:**
You should tell her, secrets tear up a marriage. Even something big like this could sneak in and ruin everything. 

**THATCHER:**
Personal experience? 

**HOLLUS:**
I cheated on her. Back in the first year of our marriage, I thought I had a pass since we were fighting every day. Then Fred was born and he just glued us together. Some days I forgot what I did. Others I told myself never again. Then of course I tell her one night years after Fred left the house. Oh! It was a dumb fight, something about her sister staying at the house. She starts talking about my failed gold business and my depression and I just needed to hurt her. So I screamed at her about cheating on her. And I can’t tell you how quickly I wanted to die right there. I wanted, no, I needed God to take me away from her. He didn’t and then I lost everything. 

**HOLLUS:**
It wasn’t quick; it was years of losing fancy cars and pets to gambling. She never took a cent from me but she still found a way to take my life away. She kept growing and finding her best life. I never felt happy since. Gosh! She just rebounded like I was a small part of her life. I just loved her so much! How could she, just drop me?’ 

**THATCHER:**
I don’t know. Funny how it works out like that.  

**HOLLUS:**
No one prepared me for this. No booklet or talk. How is a man supposed to relearn to walk at sixty? I thought I was done, my path was set you know? 

**THATCHER:**
Why take her with you? Why not just go out by yourself?  

**HOLLUS:**
And let her win?

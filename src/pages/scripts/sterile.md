Marian
They never knew how dirty they were. 

Vire
Who did? 

Marian
The people, you know who. 

Vire
And how did you feel about their dirtiness? 

Marian
I hated them so I dealt with them. I’ve told you this? Why do you care? 

Vire
No reason. Just walk me through how you dealt with them?

Marian
Well I crushed them, burnt them, poisoned them. Anything to get them out of my house. I remember one of them tried and I didn’t let them. It felt weird. 

Vire
What did they try? 

Marian
I don’t know, something they weren't supposed to. So I stopped them. 

Vire
Then how did you know what they did was bad? 

Marian
I just knew okay!? It doesn’t matter anyway it's over. Can we talk about the present?

Vire
Sure, what do you want to talk about? 

Marian
I got a car. It’s old but it runs, my old man is proud of me for getting it. He says it really makes me have a new start. 

Vire
Have you cleaned it up much? 

Marian
Yeah I’ve vacuumed the insides and washed the outsides. 

Vire
Come on.

Marian
What? 

Vire
You did more than that.

Marian
Well I might have washed down the leather seats 

Vire
And? 

Marian
The hubcaps?

Vire
Don’t make me say it. Just tell me everything. 

Marian
I don’t know what you want me to say?

Vire
Your hands are raw. I see that your palms are covered in bandages. You're regressing aren't you? 

Marian
No! I’m doing fine. I’ve been healing. I haven’t cleaned my bathroom in three weeks just like you said to do. 

Vire
But you’ve been cleaning your car for hours every day. I can see paint peeling off of it from here. If you think you're spiraling just tell me there’s no shame in it. 

Marian
I’m not spiraling. I’m just careful about my car that’s all.

Vire
Well I’m booking you for more sessions okay?

Marian
I’m not gonna do them, I'm fine. Could you just drop it? If you want me to be better you have to give me a chance to live life. 

Vire
All right, just give me a call if you need help. Now go have a good rest of your day all right. 

Marian
Alright I’ll do that 

Vire
And hey leave the car be. A little dust won’t hurt it. 

Marian
I’ll try. 

Narrator
Vire’s phone rang in the middle of the night.

Marian
Sorry I’m really sorry about it. It was just so dirty.

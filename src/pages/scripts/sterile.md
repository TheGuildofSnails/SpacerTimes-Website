# Sterile

**MARIAN:**
They never knew how dirty they were. 

**VIRE:**
Who did? 

**MARIAN:**
The people, you know who. 

**VIRE:**
And how did you feel about their dirtiness? 

**MARIAN:**
I hated them so I dealt with them. I’ve told you this? Why do you care? 

**VIRE:**
No reason. Just walk me through how you dealt with them?

**MARIAN:**
Well I crushed them, burnt them, poisoned them. Anything to get them out of my house. I remember one of them tried and I didn’t let them. It felt weird. 

**VIRE:**
What did they try? 

**MARIAN:**
I don’t know, something they weren't supposed to. So I stopped them. 

**VIRE:**
Then how did you know what they did was bad? 

**MARIAN:**
I just knew okay!? It doesn’t matter anyway it's over. Can we talk about the present?

**VIRE:**
Sure, what do you want to talk about? 

**MARIAN:**
I got a car. It’s old but it runs, my old man is proud of me for getting it. He says it really makes me have a new start. 

**VIRE:**
Have you cleaned it up much? 

**MARIAN:**
Yeah I’ve vacuumed the insides and washed the outsides. 

**VIRE:**
Come on.

**MARIAN:**
What? 

**VIRE:**
You did more than that.

**MARIAN:**
Well I might have washed down the leather seats 

**VIRE:**
And? 

**MARIAN:**
The hubcaps?

**VIRE:**
Don’t make me say it. Just tell me everything. 

**MARIAN:**
I don’t know what you want me to say?

**VIRE:**
Your hands are raw. I see that your palms are covered in bandages. You're regressing aren't you? 

**MARIAN:**
No! I’m doing fine. I’ve been healing. I haven’t cleaned my bathroom in three weeks just like you said to do. 

**VIRE:**
But you’ve been cleaning your car for hours every day. I can see paint peeling off of it from here. If you think you're spiraling just tell me there’s no shame in it. 

**MARIAN:**
I’m not spiraling. I’m just careful about my car that’s all.

**VIRE:**
Well I’m booking you for more sessions okay?

**MARIAN:**
I’m not gonna do them, I'm fine. Could you just drop it? If you want me to be better you have to give me a chance to live life. 

**VIRE:**
All right, just give me a call if you need help. Now go have a good rest of your day all right. 

**MARIAN:**
Alright I’ll do that 

**VIRE:**
And hey leave the car be. A little dust won’t hurt it. 

**MARIAN:**
I’ll try. 

**NARRATOR:**
Vire’s phone rang in the middle of the night.

**MARIAN:**
Sorry I’m really sorry about it. It was just so dirty.

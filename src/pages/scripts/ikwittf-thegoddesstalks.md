# I Know What It Takes To Fly: The Goddess Talks

**NARRATOR:**
Susie was a young girl, chosen to become a Goddess among men. She would sit on the glowing throne. A magnificent seat made from the glowing uranium in the deep valley. Every day Susie, now Gorek the fifteenth, would be painted from head to toe in paint made from the ore. Every night she would wear clothes made from it. She’d glow and show the raw power of The Gorek Empire. 

**SUSIE:**
I’m nervous.

**DEBREA:**
Oh, why dear goddess? 

**SUSIE:**
I don’t want to be seen in all this.

**NARRATOR:**
She shook her uranium dress with all its layers. 

**DEBREA:**
It’s an honor goddess. There are plenty of girls that would do anything to wear those clothes.

**SUSIE:**
It’s hot.

**NARRATOR:**
Debrea licked her brush before beginning to paint Susie's face in uranium paint. She painted the mighty symbols of her empire on Susie’s tiny forehead. 

**DEBREA:**
Such is the price of God-hood dear.

**SUSIE:**
And why did you never become a princess? Mom says you’ve been serving forever.

**DEBREA:**
Goddesses don’t have family dear.

**NARRATOR:**
Susie sighed. 

**SUSIE:**
Yes, the empire is my family.

**DEBREA:**
Good, well I would say the Gods never thought me worthy. Not that I don’t mind, serving is a worthy goal.

**SUSIE:**
Well, that’s not fair!

**NARRATOR:**
Susie lifted her arms for Debrea. She painted a rose pattern along her arm, carefully licking the brush so it doesn’t fray ruining her work. 

**DEBREA:**
This life isn’t meant to be fair. The Gods thought us unworthy.

**SUSIE:**
They just sound mean.

**DEBREA:**
Maybe so. But we bear our burdens anyway.

**SUSIE:**
I’m bored. I want to go play.

**DEBREA:**
Goddesses don’t play dear.

**NARRATOR:**
Susie scowled. Debrea began to paint her legs. She was careful to coat them in the glowing paint.  

**SUSIE:**
Well, maybe I don’t want to be a goddess.

**NARRATOR:**
Debrea chuckled.

**DEBREA:**
We don’t get to decide dear. If we did I’m sure we’d never have another scrapper again. 

**NARRATOR:**
Susie wanted to keep talking but Debrea began to paint her mouth. Taking time to coat her lips with a dotted pattern. After Debrea was done the priests took Susie to her throne. The uranium's green glow lit the sky. The hordes of scrappers and miners bathed in its glow. The roaring cheer shocked Susie as the temple shook from their stomping.  

**ROTH:**
Oh! Great woe! Your Princess has arrived! Shout, shout for life is full of beauty!

**NARRATOR:**
The crowd responded by belting out shouts. Baskets of fish and ore were placed on Susie's throne. 

**ROTH:**
Let the harvests of the earth be glorious! Let the land sing!

**NARRATOR:**
Susie saw her mom and dad in the crowd. She tried to wave but a priest was quick to sneakily push her hand down. 

**ROTH:**
Let the blessing begin!

**NARRATOR:**
Susie was handed her glowing staff. She timidly began her dance. Her flowing clothes waved through the sky as she began to leap through the air. Her paints flashed the sky with immaculate beauty as she twirled and spun. The crowd clapped and danced with her. It was a good day to be a goddess.

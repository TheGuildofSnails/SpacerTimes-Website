# The Ballroom

The show ends, you return home and lie down. Your eyes close, and the ballroom opens. You enter it, exiting the world you knew, the universe you called home. However, you feel strangely at peace here, in this place, The Ballroom. The place for neither the living nor the dead, simply the ones who never were and always will be.
Your suit appears, and envelops your body, fitting just as it should. The lights shine, but do not quite sparkle. The music begins, played by an orchestra who you can hear, but not see, for an audience of seemingly just yourself. Their wistful tone, however, touches all points of your body and mind, and as the music continues, they appear. Seeming to manifest from nothingness, the ballroom fills with souls from times past, present, and future. As you don your mask, the music calls to you, and you join the twirling figures of the ballroom as they dance through the nights of years gone by. Back in the material world, your mind has faded and withered, body following closely behind. But it is alright, for the ballroom comforts you in the warm tone of itself, and the symphony continues to beckon you to dance through the eternal night, and finish out your final waltz.

May the ballroom remain eternal. C’est fini.

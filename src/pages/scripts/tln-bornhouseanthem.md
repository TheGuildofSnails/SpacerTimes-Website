# The Lords Nation: Bornhouse Anthem

**NARRATOR:**
Tolly stood in the elevator. Her small stature makes it hard to rotate the lever. Tolly just thought that it was a part of the training. Still it was a good day as the sun was going down and the cool breeze was allowed to move through the cart. A scholar entered the cart, with a quick bow Tolly got to work. The cart moved slowly across the great chasm. The sky a brilliant red. The cart just a speck in the air. 

**SCHOLAR:**
You’re keeping on your studies.

**TOLLY:**
Yes, sir.

**SCHOLAR:**
Good, we need bright minds.

**TOLLY:**
Thank you sir.

**NARRATOR:**
The scholar watched the sky for a moment. Seeing the loose clouds. 

**SCHOLAR:**
Tell me what makes the sky so beautiful?

**TOLLY:**
Me?

**SCHOLAR:**
Who else?

**NARRATOR:**
Tolly took a moment to answer.

**TOLLY:**
Because it is. We know beauty when we see beauty.

**SCHOLAR:**
Hmm…

**NARRATOR:**
Tolly felt embarrassed, her cheeks turning a pink. 

**SCHOLAR:**
I see you're a lot smarter than me at your age. When I was asked that I gave some complicated answer about color theory.

**TOLLY:**
(assuring) That sounds like a smart answer.

**SCHOLAR:**
(disinterested) _Smart…_

**TOLLY:**
(concerned) Are you okay sir?

**NARRATOR:**
He looked back at the sky.

**SCHOLAR:**
How old are you?

**TOLLY:**
Fourteen sir.

**SCHOLAR:**
That's good, you got a good life ahead of you. I’ve turned fifty a few days ago.

**TOLLY:**
Congratulations sir.

**SCHOLAR:**
Thanks..

**NARRATOR:**
He stayed quiet for a much longer time. [cranking] The sound of the crank moving in the silent world. 

**SCHOLAR:**
Do you fear death?

**TOLLY:**
What?

**SCHOLAR:**
Death, do you fear it?

**TOLLY:**
(fearfully) No?

**SCHOLAR:**
I do, even at your age I felt that fear. I guess I need to face it sometime.

**NARRATOR:**
She looked at him without speaking.

**SCHOLAR:**
I spent the past thirty years looking for a why. Seems I’m cursed to never find such a reason. 

**NARRATOR:**
[creaking and small thud] He stood from the seat carefully placing down his briefcase. Tolly wanted to move back from him but she stayed put. 

**SCHOLAR:**
Maybe some of us never were meant to have a reason? You should find yours if you can.

**NARRATOR:**
That was the last thing the Scholar said before walking to the edge of the cart and jumping…

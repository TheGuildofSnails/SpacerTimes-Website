# Circus: Boaz

**NARRATOR:** The night snuck in a band of soldiers. They carried hundred twenty millimeter rounds along with steel mortars. They had a simple reason, and full ability to use force. They reached the hill that over sat a small village of non hybrid humans. In this dark they began to set up their assault. 

**BOAZ:** We got those mortars set up?

**ZACHERY:** Halfway there sir!

**NARRATOR:** [sfx. Busywork] The hybrid men sat their mortars down before staking them into the ground. The mismatched hands and feet providing challenges for them. Some with their excruciating elephant mods helpfully pushed down the spikes. While those who had the paws of cats mended into their arms used their delicate paws to tie the knots. 

**BOAZ:** Lots of humans down there you reckon?

**ZACHERY:** No sir, I don’t see any humans. 

**BOAZ:** Ha!, well we’re gonna give them a show no matter how human they are.

**NARRATOR:** [sfx. Shells loaded] Men with the eyes of bats carefully loaded the shells into the mortar. One of the few benefits of being modded allowed them to do this without light. 

**BOAZ:** Let me be clear. We intended to send several warning shots _above_ the town. But unfortunately we made the mistake of setting our targets too _low_. As such, we were forced to bombard the town before an angry mob attacked and killed us. A very unfortunate mistake, I don’t need any of you to dispute this story. Do not- break the story.

**NARRATOR:** The soldiers all silently agreed. 

**ZACHERY:** To add to his point, please don’t speak to anyone you don’t have to. They will try to guilt you, call you the bad guy for what you did tonight. It's all slander! We’re simply getting done what every treaty couldn’t. They’ve had ten years to leave, this is their choice.

**NARRATOR:** The men set up the mortars. Their range leveled at ground height. Shells ready to be fired. All they had to do was pull the crank. 

**BOAZ:** [yell] Fire! 

[sfx. Loud cannon shot, explosions]

**NARRATOR:** The mortars went off all at once. Their shells flying brilliantly through the sky. They flared from side to side before striking at wooden roofs. [sfx. flames] The columns of fire rose, panic could be heard from down below. Families rushed out of their homes to see where the explosions where coming from. Before they could figure it out a second round of mortar shots were fired. 

**ZACHERY:** [shouting] Whoohoo!

**NARRATOR:** This firing continued until dawn, where a stream of refugees could be seen leaving their homes. Most of them barefoot, every one of them changed. Behind them, their village sat- shattered. Family homes, churches, jolly businesses sat collapsed, charred, and broken down. Bodies were stuck in the rubble, organs and clothes mixed in with the burnt wood. 

**BOAZ:** Pack it up boi’s! We will not be getting any medals, but what we did here today will mean more to our great country even if they won’t say so.

PRESBY
So what?

FINCH
So it matters!

PRESBY
It matters?

FINCH
It matters enough, I mean it's not the whole issue.

PRESBY
Well how much?

FINCH
How much what?

PRESBY
In percentages how much? 

FINCH
Well okay fine, so you have a sub right?

PRESBY
Yes. 

FINCH
Good, on this sub you gots your meats and cheeses. These things are bases. 

PRESBY
Bases?

FINCH
Yes! Bases, they keep a good base taste for the condiments.

PRESBY
Alright, bases.

FINCH
Then you got your mayonnaise. Now a fool believes the mayo makes the sandwich; the one in the know can tell the mustard matters more. The mustard, see? The mustard is sour enough to balance the mayonnaise. It allows a diverse level of hodgepodge you can’t get with just mayo. 

PRESBY
Okay I see, counterpoint. Is there a chance you like mustard for its danger element? I mean you miss a bite or you take too much and mustard just ruins your uniform.

FINCH
Why would you assume I’d mess up a sandwich? I’m a grown man I can handle some danger.
PRESBY
That's why you chose accounting?

FINCH
Low blow mr.propaganda. 

PRESBY
Hey! I spent two years fighting Woolters.

FINCH
In which you didn’t fire your gun once, that wasn’t training. 

PRESBY
Well what can I say? At least I gave the enemy a chance to shoot me.

FINCH
Hey a real hero, speaking of heroes. Did you see they got that rebel camp down in the South District? 

PRESBY
Yeah thirteen captured crazy stuff, Isaiah’s jumping with joy right now. Honestly I don’t see why, if anything our weekends are shot with all the material we're gonna have to spin. I mean one of the guys shot a woman! Shameful.

FINCH
I don’t know, you turned that train crash into a positive issue for the country.

PRESBY
Well that train didn’t burn down a ballroom and shoot a woman. Anyway it doesn’t matter, we’re probably gonna bury it. We have some foreign media we’re gonna introduce. It has some drug use so that should feed the newsboys for a bit.

FINCH
Weird huh? What it takes to manage a population. It’s hard to put it in words. It just feels off.

PRESBY
Lying, I do the lying and you fund it. If the average person knew what we buried, spun, exaggerated, I mean they’d riot. 

FINCH
Well what can you do? If it wasn’t us someone else would take the role. I’d rather be on the other side of the progergander than the propagandized.

PRESBY
Save the big words for me Presby. Before I forget the lady is making sweaters for everyone for Christmas and she needs all your guy’s measurements.

FINCH
Alright I’ll get all that to you tomorrow. I don’t know though with all this sub talk she might want to add a couple more threads to mine.

PRESBY
I’ll see you at closing time, Finch. I gotta get to this meeting. 
See you later.

FINCH
See ya.

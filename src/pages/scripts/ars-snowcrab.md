# A readers story - Snow Crab
##### Wrote by Ethan Skinner

**NARRATOR:** [snobby] How could she? How dare she! I recommend snow crab and she just _ignores_ it? Does she know how much she can save? What’s so special about blue crab? It’s rare!? So what? Pull up a google search and look at it. It’s like eating the rarest can of _spam_. Oh _sure_, it’s rare but it’s still twenty years old. Let her enjoy her rare _garbage_, maybe she can put _“rare”_ gold flakes on it to waste even more money. Have it prepared by monkeys with _asthma_. It doesn’t matter that I spent four years in culinary school _huh_? Or that I run the best spot in Montana. Well, not one I _own_, but it still counts. In fact I think it counts _more_, I’m on the ground, a real _soldier_ in the culinary war! [short pause] Whatever, I’m the only one in this state that can _actually_ cook. Let her eat her _subpar_ crab.

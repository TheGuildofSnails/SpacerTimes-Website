# Sanity Erased 2: The Horror Within.
##### written by Stephen Newhand

#### SFX: DOOR CREAKS OPEN, SOUND OF SOMEONE SITTING IN CHAIR

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
### (relaxed)
Ah, Mr. Binder, we've been expecting you, how is our star patient?

## MELVIN
She's still catatonic sir. We've been trying to get her to talk to us, but she's not saying much of anything really.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
But she is saying something?

## MELVIN
Yes. One word, "cold." Over and over again. We've given her blankets, taken her temperature, everything. Just..."cold."

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
That is most concerning. Tell me Melvin, what do you think caused this?

## MELVIN
Well, thanks to the audiodiary we found on her. My best guess is that the trauma of almost dying, partnered with seeing her entire crew get murdered, caused her to wind up in some sort of fugue-like state. Medically speaking, she's fine, but her mind seems to be, well, fractured.

#### SFX: RUFFLING OF PAPERS

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
That does match up with the data my head scientist has given me.

## MELVIN
### (insulted)
Head scientist? I thought I was your head scientist?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
You're the head scientist for this facility, you don't think you're the only one, do you?

## MELVIN
I guess not.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
As I was saying. I've spoken with my head scientist, and he believes that her mind is broken, and the pieces need to manually be put back together. That's where you come in.

## MELVIN 
I mean, I have some basic medical knowledge, but I'm not a brain surgeon.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
### (harsh) 
If you'd stop interrupting me, I can finish explaining. You're going to go into her mind, find the traumatic memory that's stopping her from waking up, and help her process it.

## MELVIN
### (insulted)
You're joking, right? I was coming in here to call in my favor! You said you owed me?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
### (jovial)
Wait, you believed that? It was my attempt at humor! You honestly thought that you intercepting someone who was on a top secret mission, and then subsequently listening to a classified document would make us, owe you a favor?

## MELVIN
### (sheepish) 
Well, when you put it that way...

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
That's what I thought. Perhaps the last time we dove into your mind we didn't put everything back where it belongs.

## MELVIN
Wait, you went into my mind?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Standard hiring procedure, don't worry about it. Anyway, we'll be in touch through this communication device, it sends a signal via quantum technology.

## MELVIN
And if I refuse?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
I don't recommend you doing that. The job market for head scientist is quite competitive, and I'm told that being alive is almost always a prerequisite.

## MELVIN
So that's how it is?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
It certainly is. Now get down to the medbay, we're prepping the device now.

## MELVIN
### (apprehensive)
Great.

#### END SCENE

#### SFX: WHIRRING OF MACHINES AND BEEPING OF HEART MONITOR

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Alright Melvin, can you hear me?

## MELVIN
### (reluctant and agitated)
Loud and clear.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Good. Now sit in the chair next to Morgan's bed and the attendant will situate you within the apparatus.

## MELVIN
Great.

## ATTENDANT
Ok Melvin, hold still real quick while I put this neural net on you. It will take a moment to synchronize both yours and Morgan's theta brain waves, which will allow you to enter her subconscious.

## MELVIN
And once in there, what am I supposed to do?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
You're to go through her memories, and attempt to rectify any traumatic or incongruous recollections.

## MELVIN
What does that mean?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
You'll know it when you see it. Has anyone ever told you that you ask a lot of questions?

## MELVIN
That's the nature of being a scientist, asking questions.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Yes, that may be true, but you never ask the right ones.

## MELVIN
What's that supposed to mean?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
See? That's exactly what I'm talking about.

## ATTENDANT
Delta waves synchronized, intiating experimental process number four dash two.

#### SFX: RHYTHMIC HUMMING INCREASING IN SPEED AND FREQUENCY, FADES OUT.

#### END SCENE

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
### (distant, echo-y)
Melvin? Hello? Are you in there?

## MELVIN
### (shaken up)
I...I...I'm here. I feel very nauseous at the moment.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
But you're not bleeding profusely out of your orifaces?

## MELVIN
Uh, I don't think so? No. No I'm not.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Excellent. (distant) Mark, write that down.

## MELVIN
You're telling me no ones done this before?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Yes, they most certainly have. Just, uh, not successfully. Until you that is. More importantly, though, what do you see?

## MELVIN
I'm in...an office complex? There's a long row of doors and hallways it looks like. They all look different, some of them are really fancy, but others, well, they look like they belong to a crime scene.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Perfect, it sounds like you're in her memory banks. Took us forever to figure out the right location, we once sent this poor soul to the colon...

## MELVIN
Excuse me? You what?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
It's not important. Try one of the doors.

#### SFX: DOOR HANDLE JIGGLING

## MELVIN
It's locked.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Damn. It's the same issue we had last time.

## MELVIN
You know, you're not very helpful.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
We got you this far didn't we?

## MELVIN
To do a job you forced me to do!

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Focus. There must be a key nearby.

## MELVIN
There's gotta be dozens of doors here? You think I'm gonna find a key? There's not even a spot for them on these doors, they look like... doors to a kid's bedroom.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Interesting. Maybe there's a specific knock sequence.

## MELVIN
I thought you said you had done this before?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
In a manner of speaking. We'd never sent anyone in before, just viewed the memories remotely. Like the difference between seeing a movie versus a live play. If our theories are correct, you'll be able to look around the memories, as opposed to just watch them play back.

## MELVIN
Can I manipulate them?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
No, and don't try, it could make things far worse. These are her memories after all, it would be unethical at the very least.

## MELVIN
Good point. How do I get out?

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
When the job is done.

#### SFX: FAINT FOOTSTEPS

## MELVIN
Have you gotten your head examined lately- Wait...I hear footsteps.

## MORGAN
Hello? Is someone there?

## MELVIN
Holy shit, it's Morgan. She sounds just like her audiodiary, just, not scared.

## UNKNOWN MALE VOICE
Alright. That must be her inner voice. Maybe she'll be able to help you fix...herself? Freud would be having a field day if he hadn't been dead for centuries. Anyway, I'm going to go radio silent, but we're going to monitor your audio still, just in case. Over and out.

## MELVIN
Roger.

#### SFX: SMALL BOOPING NOISE SIGNIFYING MUTING OF COMMS.

## MELVIN
Morgan, is that you?

#### SFX: FOOTSTEPS COME CLOSER

## MORGAN
How do you know my name?

## MELVIN
Look, it's a long and complicated story. But basically you were on a mission with your crew and you were attacked. You made it out OK, but apparently your mind was fractured due to the trauma. I'm here to help.

## MORGAN
Right...I think I remember. But, it's not quite there. Like when you set something in sand, the imprint is there, but the object itself is missing.

## MELVIN
That's what I'm here for, to help you remember and hopefully you can wake up.

## MORGAN
But that doesn't tell me how you know my name. How do I know you're not another manifestation? I've run into so many at this point.

## MELVIN
Well Morgan, I actually know a lot about you, thanks to the audio logs you left on Brian's recorder. You teleported to my outpost in a heap. We were able to stabilize you, physically speaking. But mentally, you had endured so much.

## MORGAN
So you knew Brian?

## MELVIN
In a way, yes. We were funded by the same company. But they have their hands in a lot of pots, so to speak. We just do what we're told.

## MORGAN
### (contemptfully)
Typical pencil-pushers.

## MELVIN
Yeah, well this pencil-pusher is here to fix your broken head. Now how does this place work?

## MORGAN
Your boss didn't tell you?

## MELVIN
That, he did not. He didn't tell me much at all actually. Just that I would know when I knew.

## MORGAN
Wow. You need to learn how to ask questions. How do I know I can trust you?

## MELVIN
Do you have any better options?

## MORGAN
Good point. So, this place is weird to say the least. It seems to exist outside of time and space. I've been here forever, and I just got here, if that makes sense.

## MELVIN
It doesn't make any sense at all!

## MORGAN
I suppose it doesn't to you. But I've had a lot of time to work it out, I think? I'm a manifestation of my own subconscious, my minds way of navigating my own memories.

## MELVIN
And I'm assuming that's what these doors are.

## MORGAN
I think so! I haven't had a chance to go through any yet.

## MELVIN
You haven't? But I thought this was your mind?

## MORGAN
I just got here, remember? Time doesn't work the same in here.

## MELVIN
Right. You did say that.

## MORGAN
Alright, let's get moving. I suggest we pick a door and see what memory it serves up.

## MELVIN
Works for me. Let's open this fancy one right here. Seems like a safe choice.

#### SFX: DOOR CREAKS OPEN
#### SFX: MUFFLED SOUNDS OF CHEERING AND POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE, ETC.

## COMMANDER EVERETT
### (regal sounding, but muffled, as if from very far away)
It is with my esteemed honor that I present the valedictorian award to Morgan Fischer!

## MORGAN
Oh wow, this is from when I graduated the academy! I was so young and full of hope!

## MELVIN
I'm assuming that faded?

## MORGAN
### (flat)
Definitely. Let's keep moving.

## MELVIN
Alright, let's go to this one.

## MEMORY MORGAN
### (younger sounding, stressed)
I don't know if I can do this! I will never be able to qualify for search and rescue if I don't pass this exam! (sobbing)

## MELVIN
### (awkward)
This...is not a happy memory.

## MORGAN
No, no it isn't. But I'd say it all worked out for the best, well, mostly.

## MELVIN
Next memory?

## MORGAN
Yes.

#### SFX: SHUTTING OF DOOR, OPENING OF ANOTHER

## COMMANDER EVERETT
### (stern)
Attention new recruits! For the next twelve cosmo-months, your asses are my property! You will not breath without my say-so! Do I make myself clear?

## RECRUITS 
### (INCLUDING MORGAN) (chanted)
Sir yes, sir!

## MELVIN
This guy seems like a real peach.

## MORGAN
He really isn't, he just has to act that way to get us to obey. In reality he's a really nice guy, he was like a father figure to me...

## MELVIN
That's great, but let's get a move on, eh?

## MORGAN
### (startled)
Yeah, right.

#### SFX: DOOR SHUTTING

## MELVIN
So these all seem to be from you space explorer training, shall we try another area? These doors over here are painted a different color.

## MORGAN
Hey, your guess is as good as mine. It's worth a shot, as long as it makes me the real me again and not whatever *I* am.

## MELVIN
Alright, here we go. What's behind door number one?

#### SFX: DOOR OPENS, CRYING BABY SOUNDS

## MORGAN'S DAD
### (distraught)
I just don't know what to do, I've tried changing her, rocking her, feeding her, nothing is working!

## MELVIN
### (amused)
Is, is that baby you?

## MORGAN
### (deflated)
I think so.

#### SFX: CRYING CONTINUES

## MORGAN'S MOM
### (also distraught)
Have you tried patting her back?

## MORGAN'S DAD
### (defeated)
Several times. Maybe we're just not to be good at this?

## MORGAN'S MOM
### (reassuring)
Don't be like that. Let me hold her for a second.

#### SFX: CRYING STOPS, BABY STARTS COOING.

## MORGAN'S DAD
### (amused)
Talk about a mother's touch.

## MELVIN
Alright, I don't think what we're looking for is in here.

## MORGAN
### (flatly)
Right.

#### SFX: DOOR CLOSES, FOOTSTEPS, ANOTHER OPENS.

## MORGAN
Weird, I don't remember this one.

## MELVIN
Is that you as a child, with your grandfather?

## MORGAN
### (distant)
No, it can't be...

## MORGAN'S GRANDFATHER
-that story? Well, your parent's *are* away on that mission. So I guess what they don't know won't hurt them. It'll be are little secret.

#### SFX: PAGES OF A BOOK TURNING.

## MORGAN'S GRANDFATHER
Long, long ago our ancestors told the tale of the mythical man eating beast. He would travel from planet to planet, gobbling up everything in sight. They say it got so big it could gobble entire planets in one bite, without a minute's warning. People had to live in ships for the longest time, always afraid the man eater would get them.

## MELVIN
This is not a story for kids...

## MORGAN
Shhh!

## MORGAN'S GRANDFATHER
Until one day when all of the smartest men and women put their heads together and came up with a plan. They found a remote section of the galaxy where there was no one around for light years and light years. They would trap the monster there.

## MELVIN
This is it!

## MORGAN
What?

## MELVIN
Our way out of here!

## MORGAN'S GRANDFATHER
-they had the man eater chase them! For years they kept it pursuit, with a few close calls. But eventually the plan worked! The man eater was the size of a small rodent. But that wasn't enough, they say it was trapped on some worthless element, so no one would even think of going near it! Too small to be a threat, and too far away from anything it could eat, that was the last we ever heard of the man eater, or sometimes known as a-

#### SFX: PHONE RINGS

## MORGAN'S GRANDFATHER
Now who could be calling at this hour?

## MORGAN
### (solemn)
Let's go.

#### SFX: DOOR SHUTS.

## MELVIN
That's weird. We're still here?

## MORGAN
### (upset)
What do you mean?

## MELVIN
My employer told me that I would know what I was looking for when I saw it. I'd say we just saw a pretty big revelation.

## MORGAN
### (still upset)
Revelation? That's your takeaway from that? Because that was the night my parents died.

## MELVIN
### (apologetic)
Oh shit, no, no I am so sorry. I didn't know that at all.

## MORGAN
### (sarcastic) 
Your "higher ups" didn't tell you?

## MELVIN
I already told you, they didn't tell me anything. Only thing I was told to come in here and fix your mind. I'm on a need to know basis here. I work in a lab for crying out loud. Let's just move on to the next door, okay?

## MORGAN 
Fine. I'll be right behind you.

#### SFX: DOOR OPENING

## MORGAN
### (sobbing)
>

## MORGAN'S GRANDFATHER
### (somber)
I'm sorry kiddo. I wish I could take all the pain you're feeling and take it up inside me. But what I can do is tell you it will get better. Not today, not tomorrow, not even the day after that, but it will eventually get better. I've been through it myself, more times than I care to count I'm afraid. That stabbing pain in your chest will eventually fade into a dull ache, it will never go away completely, but I swear you won't want it to. Because that pain will always serve as a reminder. A reminder of the ones you love, and the ones you've lost. Not a day goes by where I don't think of them. Like a broken bone, it might take a little bit, but you'll heal, you'll get broken, and then you'll heal again. Each time stronger, tougher, but a little scar left behind, as a reminder. These are the things that make us grow, not physically, but mentally. Now, how about some ice cream?

## MELVIN
### (quiet)
Let's go.

#### SFX: DOOR SHUTS.

## MELVIN
That was...heavy.

## MORGAN
### (sobbing)
You think?

## MELVIN
Do you need a minute?

## MORGAN
I'm good. (sighs) I'm good. Just bringing back, reliving? I don't know. Seeing them all again, it's like, I remember the lesson he taught, but the lesson itself isn't as fresh? If it wasn't for him I never would've had the courage to get through my first year of space explorer academy.

## MELVIN
Sounds like he was a great guy.

## MORGAN
The greatest.

## MELVIN
Let's go to another area then, I don't think I'm going to find what we're looking for here.

## MORGAN
Agreed.

#### SFX: FEW SECONDS OF ECHO-Y FOOTSTEPS, FADE IN: CLUB MUSICAL BEAT

## MELVIN
Music? That's weird. It's coming from that section over there? It looks like the doors are covered in...cupids, rainbows, and barbed wire?

## MORGAN
That would be my romantic memories. Whatever your looking for is -not- in there.

## MELVIN
Duly noted. Hey, what about these doors, they all look like doors to space ships?

## MORGAN
That sounds a lot more like what we're looking for.

#### SFX: DOOR OPENS

## BENJAMIN
Alright team, I'd like to welcome our newest member, Morgan Fischer. She graduated top of her class at the academy and will hopefully be an asset to the team.

## YOUNGER MORGAN
### (shy)
I will certainly try my best.

## BENJAMIN
We wouldn't expect any less. This is Marcus, my second in command, and right hand man. He'll get your equipment set up.

## MARCUS
You ever shoot a sparkrifle before?

## YOUNGER MORGAN
### (meekly)
A-a-a couple of times.

## BENJAMIN
A couple of times? Don't sell yourself short there rookie, I was told you set the marksmanship record!

## MARCUS
Hey, that was mine!

## BENJAMIN
Well, it's hers now!

## MARCUS
Well, hopefully that's the only record of mine she'll be breaking. Benjamin, can we not discuss how much better she is then I am?

## YOUNGER MORGAN
I didn't say that...

## MARCUS
See? She's even more humble than I am!

## MELVIN
Was this your crew?

## MORGAN
### (saddened)
Yeah. They were like big brothers to me. I remember this day like yesterday. I was so nervous that I wasn't good enough, that I wasn't going to fit in. I wanted to run the first chance I got, but I stuck through, and became part of the family. Next door please.

## BENJAMIN
### (elated)
Man, what a rush! Another successful mission!

## JANE
### (also excited)
No kidding! That got hairy back there. That was some fine shooting Morgan! No one else saw that tango coming but you!

## YOUNGER MORGAN
### (shyly)
It was nothing! I was just doing my job.

## BENJAMIN
Well it was a hell of a job! You're really earning your stripes here rookie!

## MARCUS
Yeah, you really saved our asses, not only did we save Mr. Crow here, but our shields didn't even get hit once.

## MR CROW
### (important sounding)
My sincerest thanks to all of you. The nation of Caztalchia will ensure that you're handsomely rewarded.

## BENJAMIN
Don't mention it sir, it's what we do.

#### SFX: WHOOSHING OF SPACESHIP DOOR

## BENJAMIN
### (suspicious)
Now where the hell have you been? Morgan saved our skin and you were nowhere to be found!

## JANE
### (accusatory)
You better not have been going through my diary!

## BRIAN
### (smug and conniving)
If you must know I was preparing the comms to send a distress beacon.

## MARCUS
A beacon? For what? Things got dicey, but we made it through.

## BRIAN
I was unsure of our ability to pull ourselves out of the situation.

## JANE
You didn't think the rookie could her own, did you?

## BRIAN
She certainly has...exceeded my expectations.

## MARCUS
Well, you better start raising them, because she is a certified bad ass!

## YOUNGER MORGAN
Ah geez guys...

## BENJAMIN
No more of this shy stuff! Give me a ooh rah!

## YOUNGER MORGAN
### (shyly)
Ooh... rah?

## BENJAMIN
Nah, yah gotta mean it! Ooh rah!

## YOUNGER MORGAN
### (more enthusiastic)
Ooh rah!

## BENJAMIN
There we go! We might be able to train you yet kid. Let's go home.

#### SFX: INCREASED WHOOSHING OF SPACE SHIP, CLOSING OF DOOR.

## MELVIN
Well, that was certainly a good memory.

## MORGAN
Yeah, I don't have too many of those. It was weird, it's almost like I felt... happy again.

## MELVIN
Reminiscing has a tendency to do that fortunately, I think that's why so many people do it.

## MORGAN
Yeah. Good point.

## MELVIN
Now, it looks like we're about out of hallway here, so I'm assuming this last door is the one we want.

## MORGAN
So, what does that mean?

## MELVIN
Well, hopefully it means whatever is causing your coma will be fixed and you'll wake up. I also hope that means I'll be able to leave as well.

## MORGAN
What about me?

## MELVIN
Well, you as a person will wake up. You as a manifestation of your own subconscious? That I don't know. My best guess is that you'll be reabsorbed and cease to exist.

## MORGAN
### (dryly)
That's a depressing thought.

## MELVIN
Consider the alternative, as long as the you in here exists, the you out there doesn't

## MORGAN
Ok, you got me. We doing this?

## MELVIN
Though you'd never ask.

#### SFX: DOOR OPENS, LARGE WHOOSHING NOISE, LIKE AIR FLOWING THROUGH A WINDOW

Hey, we're inside the telegrande!

That's your crew's ship, right?

#### SFX: BEEPING NOISE OF THE COMMS

## MORGAN
And there I am! I'm recording the audio diary?

## MELVIN
### (laughing)
And who said the audio medium was dead?

## MORGAN
Look out the window!

## MELVIN
It's the carbomox! It's huge!

## MORGAN
### (fearful)
No! It was not that big when we saw it! It's absolutely gigantic!

## MELVIN
Look at the side of the ship, it looks like all of the fuel containers have been ruptured.

## MORGAN
### (dismayed)
That's it! Our fuel was an experimental fuel that had a hundred times the density of regular carbon fuel.

## MELVIN
### (also dismayed)
And that's exactly what this thing eats!

## MORGAN
And it's getting bigger!

Oh no. This is not good. Is it?

## MORGAN
Flying. Yes. Yes it is. It looks like it's big enough to leave the atmosphere.

## MELVIN
That's exactly what it's doing. I need to go.

## MORGAN
Well, it was nice meeting you, Melvin.

## MELVIN
It was nice meeting you too. See you on the other side.

Melvin! Speak up! It's what?!

It's coming.

Edie arrived at the distillery. Quietly he put a freshly sharpened hunting knife on his belt loop. Giving himself a moment to breath and recite his plan, Edie’s hand was shaking slightly. Pushing himself forward, Edie began his quest of revenge. 

The distillery was full of workers, so crowded that no one even noticed Edie. His casual wear and expensive boots made him look as un-threatening as possible. As Edie sat down a waiter swooped upon his drink list in hand. 

Waiter: Hello sir, Welcome to the Washwater distillery. Would you like to hear our special of the day?  

Edie: No, I’m here for the boss. 

Waiter: I’m afraid Jack doesn’t like people dropping in. 

Edie: Really? Even old friends?

Waiter: Well I guess, just give me your name and I’ll tell you what he says. 

Edie: What if we skip the name part.

Waiter: Listen sir I already can’t get him to meet people he knows, a name would ensure a meeting. 

Edie: Would a thousand silver give me a meeting?

Waiter: For me?

Edie: Yeah, I imagine you can dream up a scenario that gets me in his office. 

Waiter: Listen I can’t lose this job, I got bills man. 

Edie: Hard bargain, huh? How about two grand in silver, should cover bills. 

Edie pulled two solid silver slips showing the two grand they entrust. The waiter looked around before giving a nod and walking away. It took him less than two minutes to get a meeting.

Waiter: The boss will see you. 

Edie: Thank you kind sir, I believe these are yours. 

Edie slipped the bills in the waiter's pockets, stopping near him before continuing. 

Edie: Be sure to get out of here bud, it might get a bit crowded. 

The waiter simply walked away, beads of sweat appearing on their forehead. 

Edie entered the boss’ office smoothly.

Boss: So I heard that you're looking to buy my establishment?  

Edie: I am, may I sit?

Boss: Please do.

Edie took a seat in the alligator skinned chair. 

Boss: So tell me, why me? 

Edie: Why not? It’s a nice little place, I imagine it brings in some silver on good days. 

Boss: Around five grand. 

Edie: See, so why not right. 

Boss: I like you stranger, what do you say we share off my famous whisky while we talk?  

Edie: I wouldn’t mind a glass. 

Boss began to make drinks. 

Edie: Nice kids. 

Boss: Thanks. 

Edie: How old are they?

Boss: Dominik’s turning twelve in March. Hell fire of a child he is, just last week he punched a kid in school for God knows what. Lucy she’s an angel, I’m almost afraid of her turning two. 

Edie: Quite the age gap. 

Boss: Well when you're in between wives it tends to take time to have another. 

Boss sat down the drinks. 

Edie: Cheers to your re-marriage!

Boss: Cheers!

With the clink of the glasses a easiness was set.

Boss: How about yourself are you divorced?

Edie: Never married, found it too complicated

Boss: Good answer! Stranger, speaking of you got a name?

Edie: Sure, not sure you want to hear it. 

Boss: Intriguing, why's that?

Edie: A man with a past tends to be a bit wary of old names popping up. 

Boss: A man with a past? I hate to tell you stranger or old friend, but I don’t have much of a past. 

Edie: Really?

Boss: Yeah, got the wrong guy, now I’m busy so have a good rest of your day now. 

Edie: So early, Dem?

Dem’s knuckles got white from gripping his drink. 

Dem: Where’d you get that name?

Edie: I don’t know, you tell me. 

Dem: Listen I can call security, they’re bad men. So if you're planning on hurting me I’d reconsider. 

Edie: Dem? Me hurting you? That’s crazy. 

Edie tossed his hunting knife on the table. 

Dem: Whoa! 

Edie: Shh, listen Dem I won’t hurt you, just hear me out. 

Dem: Alright, I’ll hear you out. Just I have kid-

Edie: And you’ll see them Dem. 

Dem: You want money? I can open my safe right now. Ten G’s, no issue. 

Edie: I don’t want Money Dem, just listen. 

Dem: What abo-

Edie: Shut up! Just listen. 

Dem put his hands up.

Edie: Just- put down your hands and listen, I’ve been planning this for awhile. 

Dem shook his head. 

Edie: Good; it's good. It’s good that your like this. On Osreme’s mining plant you were 
Hard to look at. I’m glad you gained some humanity. Still though I can’t forgive you, those beatings were awful. Starvation was something I still think about, you know? And Really I don’t blame you, I blame the system that made you. But you are the system in a way, you know? 

So I thought about it and I don’t want to kill you. You don’t deserve that, at least to me. Instead I figured another way to punish you and the system that made you. 

Dem: Well what? 

Edie: I’m not done Dem, instead- and you know what? I was going to tell you my name. It was going to be glorious, but uh you know? You don’t get to know my name, and it makes sense. The amount of people you put in your black box? The sheer amount of fingernails you’ve pulled is untold. My name really doesn’t matter at the end of this session. 

I got off track, the point is I want you to cut off your thumb. And I want it to be your right thumb, I recommend using that hunting knife there. 

Dem: Whoa whoa! Listen, I have money. I can make you rich. 

Edie: Wow! You're still on that? Listen, I didn’t want to have to tell you this. I will tourture your wife and children in the same way you did. I’ll starve your stuipid son you named after yourself, your wife will be beaten every day till the day she dies. So please consider your options. 

Sweat covered Edie’s hand. 

Dem: You're crazy!


Edie: I’m Crazy?  What about you Dem? Every time someone branded someone to be owned, you weren't crazy? What about when you took my hand and boiled it? For hours? Nothing? Actions of a sane man I guess?

Dem: Years ago, It was years ago you monster!

Edie: That's cute, just give me your right thumb Dem. 

Dem: I’m not gonna do it.

Edie: Let me help you then!

Edie grabbed Dem’s hand and pushed out his thumb. Dem attempted to punch Edie with his other hand; several head slams on his Red wood desk persuaded him otherwise.

Edie: Here’s this nice knife Dem

Edie’s pulls out a revolver from his back holster and points it at Dem’s chest.

Edie: Be sure to reconsider stabbing me. 

Dem slowly brought his knife to the outstretched thumb. Edie’s grip was so strong that blood began to get cut off. Dem silently counted this as a blessing. 

Dem: Your disgusting-

Edie: Shut up. 

Edie took the revolver’s handle and slammed it on the knife. Edie’s thumbs flew across the room along with plenty of blood.

Dem: AHH!

Dem ran into the corner of his office, gripping his now decapitated thumb. 

Edie calmly put his hunting knife away. Taking his time to pick up Dem’s thumb and put it in a leather pouch. Around his neck. 

Dem: My people will get you, I guarantee you your corpse will be hung on the side of the road. 

Edie: Good, I’ll be sure to take more fingers from your friends. Be sure to tell them how deranged I am. 

With that, Edie calmly walked out of Dem’s office. Only stopping to tell the hostess to call the police.

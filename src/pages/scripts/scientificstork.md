# Scientific Stork

PETE
Come in!

NARRATOR
Samantha sat down on the aged seat. 

PETE
Samatha Wellgns correct?

SAMANTHA
Wilgins.

PETE
Right, thanks.

NARRATOR
Pete made sure to take his time to correct the mistake with his white out. 

PETE
Wilgins. Alright, let's talk matchmaking. How's it been with Miles?

SAMANTHA
It's been going well, I feel a real good connection with him. Last week we were doing our SMT’s together and our answers were quite similar.

PETE
Good, real good. Is this your first match?

SAMANTHA
Second.

PETE
And who was your first match?

SAMANTHA
Siemens Confer.

PETE
Why did the match fallout?

SAMANTHA
Are you sure it's not in your file why it didn’t work? You guys take notes on everything.
PETE
Well I like to hear it from the source. Us matchmakers can sometimes be a little, light on details.

SAMANTHA
Well Siemens, he was a good man. I remember he was always very hardworking. Always remembered my family's birthdays and even my friend’s birthday. I always felt heard with him,but he was a very angry man.

PETE
Has he ever hit you? I don’t see that in the file. 

SAMANTHA
No, he’d never do anything like that. It was more of his anger at the outside world. If someone bumped into him he’d start cursing them out. Same with waiters at restaurants, they mess up one thing and he’d have the managers kicking us out. I’m still banned from a couple restaurants because of him. I just couldn’t imagine him at the wedding ceremony.

PETE
Besides the anger was that the only reason?

SAMANTHA
Well that's why I wanted to end the courtship, your office said that the SMT’s didn’t match.

PETE
Makes sense, Now back to Miles. With the genetics tests, did you get your test in the mail yet?

SAMANTHA
No, Miles did though.

NARRATOR
A silence held in the air for an uncomfortable amount of time. 

PETE
Well, I’m guessing you know then, sorry.


SAMANTHA
Thanks, Miles is still torn up about it.


PETE
Give him my condolences.

SAMANTHA
I will.

PETE
So, I have seen your genetic tests and let me say you have a very high fertility rate. Your motherhood test was also high. 

NARRATOR
Samanatha looked frightened at this news. 

PETE
Don’t worry, you can keep your courtship. All you need to do is sign up for a new program we’re starting. It's artificial insemination, now I know it sounds weird. I assure you it's much more simple than you could think. 

SAMANTHA
Wouldn’t that be, cheating?

PETE
No, the sperm is put into a vial with your eggs and then it's injected into your body. You never see the contributor; nor do you need to ever tell the child about its technical father.

SAMANTHA
Wait? Would Miles still father the child?

PETE
Yes, the contributor of the sperm wouldn’t even be in the paperwork. All you have to know is his genetics are a complete match.

SAMANTHA
Would the surgery be invasive?

PETE
Samantha I’m afraid I don’t have all the information. All I need you too do is think about it,okay? I’ll have Miles in with you for our weekly. There we can go more in topic. I do want to give you this book that goes more in depth. I took the time to add some other womens contact information who have also agreed to the program. You’d be shocked how many high tier women loved it.

SAMANTHA
Pete, do you feel like Miles would agree?

PETE
I couldn’t tell you. It's certainly a crushed dream for him, most men I’d imagine. I think you should talk to him. Really read the book, let him see why this is a good idea. And I’m not supposed to tell you this, but they’re willing to move him to sector three if he chooses too.

SAMANTHA
Oh, Is that confirmed for sure?

PETE
Yep, it's going to be hand signed by the governor. We’re serious about getting this program off the ground. 

SAMANTHA
How many couples are going to sign up? 

PETE
I can’t tell you the true number, but it's high.

SAMANTHA
[excited]
Wow. 

PETE
Thanks I’m proud of being able to help couples like yourself. Now, if you’ll let me go I should have someone else coming in soon. Have a good day Samantha.

SAMANTHA
You too Pete.

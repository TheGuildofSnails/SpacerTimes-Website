**Narrator (Baba Jaga)**

[more of a narration voice] Somewhere in the silent, ancient Eastern European Forest. Between the branches of the mighty Oaks, the clearing with a restaurant called Chicken Legs is where we’ll be staying at.

A dimmed light is coming out from the windows, and pink smoke is coming out of the chimney. 

Multiple voices are speaking, and a romantic violin is playing, but one voice can be heard much louder [sudden change of voice to normal Baba Jaga] - my! Ha Ha Ha Ha!

Welcome to my House this Valentine's Day, I hope you enjoy the stay! We are here to help you relax, and find love… of course.

There are a lot of choices - Liderc came here from Hungary for another chance. 

Encantado in his handsome hat is bubbling around, [with raised voice] HEY! PAY ATTENTION! CHUIAELS IS STARING AT YOU! 

[now whisper] They Both will enjoy tonight, ha ha ha!

The long-life distance lovers are here as well - Thokolosi and Popobawa are showing their African smiles, and exchanging compliments towards each other [whispering] hopefully they won't exchange anything more than that if you know what I mean

Now, please come with me. Behind my lovely house.

Look - there is a wall with a chair and a table on each side. 

And what a surprise - two postures moving closer to this spot.

I can definitely smell something… ah that must be the Skunk Ape! 

[Whispering a bit disgusted] Is that a new aftershave?

**Skunk Ape**

Yes it is! The new batch of "Burned Salmon" which was made just by myself.

What do you think about it?

**Baba Jaga**

[Very carefully and politely] It is… specific… 

Oh, and it is our "possible" second half, walking to us on human legs tonight, and luring us closer with an irresistible song [whispered] The Siren, ha ha.

**Siren**

Hell(o) [sudden stop]… what's that smell?

**Baba Jaga**

That's nothing, my child. Sit, relax, and have this special drink - Peachy Ludus!

**Skunk Ape**

[Somewhere from behind the wall with a very mellow voice] I had it already, it haaas a puuunch.

**Baba Jaga**

Good, good. [Louder to the audience] Now Welcome to the "Blind Hen Date"!

Where you will find the love of your life!

[Whispering chucklingly to herself] No refund policy - just 100% guarantee, haha.

[To the Siren] Did you finish your drink child?

**Siren**

[Still with a normal voice] Yes. It was smooth like an ocean foam waking you up on the tropical beach.

**Baba Jaga**

Good, good. Now the first part of the evening! Please open the small holes in the wall, and feel free to ask questions, but do not tell your name!

**Siren**

If you have to choose…[suddenly stop again] this smell again.

**Skunk Ape**

[Very mellow from now on] Yeees? Anything for you, darling.

Just the best smells for you. I have chosen this one because I want to be your small goldfish, who will brighten your life every morning.

**Siren**

[With normal voice] I can't stand this sme.. [pause - and now with mellow voice] Ohhh...Goldfish…? Do you like fish?

**Baba Jaga**

[In the background] Good, good, it's starting to work.

**Skunk Ape**

Yes. Big and small. Fried, smoked and fermented. 

**Siren**

You are funny, like a little monkey hanging out of the tree!

**Skunk Ape**

I would do that easily for you, my undiscovered treasure.

**Baba Jaga**

[To herself] Excellent. The potion worked, they've mentally connected. [Louder] Now let's move on with the date!

Please go to your left with your food and join together at the table just for the both of you.

**Siren**

[When she sees Skunk Ape with a laugh] You are a monkey!

**Skunk Ape**

And you are like a bright light coming through the trees at the swamp.

**Siren**

The swamp is full of water, I would love to see it, it would be a real mud bath.

[Suddenly] Aaaaaa! My legs!

**Baba Jaga**

Well… unexpected side effects.

**Skunk Ape**

I got you! [He caught her from the fall]

[With surprise] Is this a fishtail?

**Siren**

[shy and embarrassed] It is.

**Skunk Ape**

[Sniffing] It smells deliciously fishy.

**Siren**

Do you really think so? No one ever told me that.

**Skunk Ape**

[While putting her in the chair, and sitting next to her] Here, sit down and I will bring you food. I will do what I can for you, little pearl.

**Siren**

[Very emotionally] Thank you. You have very matted but soft fur. 

**Skunk Ape**

That's how driven through racoon shampoo works. Always messy and ready.

Would you like to try it? I have a jar of it with me.

**Siren**

Of course! [Excited] Please do it! Do it now! [With even more excitement]

**Skunk Ape**

My pleasure! Let me just grab this jag of water. And I'm cooooming! 

**Baba Jaga**

It looks like it's going very well. Now let's leave these fresh lovers, and give them a bit of privacy…

**Siren**

[Shouting in the background] 

WHAT THE HELL?! GET YOUR DIRTY STINKY HANDS OF ME - YOU APE!!!! 

**Skunk Ape**

[Still very mellow from the background] Close. I'm Skunk Ape, and I will do anything for you, lovely fishy.

**Baba Jaga**

Oh well, didn't expect water at work.

# Immortal 

Man
Immortality? What an odd word. To live forever, I mean only the gods achieved that. Maybe that's why I love Greek myths. I can relate to someone on the struggles of immortality. Not that I can complain about what this gift has brought me. I’ve been in thousands of loving marriages, amazing friendships, and so many adventures. This gift has allowed me to be a great actor, musician, rock climber, chef, and anything you can think of, I was. Still, I don’t wish to complain, I really don’t. [exaggerated] But it gets pointless.

Man
Martha was amazing, she would make me jump out of planes and just anything to have that adrenaline high you know? And gosh she smelled like dirt and adventure. 

Man
Sia was quiet. She cried a lot. I don’t know why I always tried to be there for her. In her good moments though, she made me feel like I mattered. She always loved the world. 

Man
Mave, sorry I don’t remember much about her. Kiwi, I know she liked kiwis. 

Man
As much as I loved them I knew it would end. Still, I could never stop myself. Mother was right, she kept me happy as much as she could. And it worked, for a time. Even my best moments are tinged with knowing mother will have to end it one day. 

Man
These days I just focus on being a good father, I was so lucky mother gave me those perfect children. I won’t lie, it's hard. Some days I think mother is wrong. But of course, then one of those babies smiles or laughs at me and it all makes sense. 

Man
I know in a micro amount of time these children will become adults with their own lives and I have to make up for my immortality again. The other day I heard someone tell me to just wipe the memories and do it again. And I hate to say it but that was on my mind. [pause of selfish] Selfish, to forget those children for my own “Happiness”. That day creeps closer and closer and as much as I trust mother I have a fear in my heart. The coldness of eternity will be back and there is nothing I can do, nothing. But today, today my children play at the park, for now that is enough. [somber] And for now, that's all I need.

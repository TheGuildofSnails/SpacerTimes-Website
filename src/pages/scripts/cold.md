# Cold

Narrator
Gorgina, Reggie, and Jarven all stand near the grave of their recently deceased father. In the freezing cold of Kentucky the siblings all take turns reading their goodbyes to their father. First was Reggie. 

Reggie
I struggled with this, you were only there for a very small portion of my life. I considered just writing a paragraph, but when I started writing I didn’t stop. My body didn’t let me. So now in honor of this labor I’ll read it. I don’t think you deserve it but someone does. 

Reggie
You were a bad father, nothing redeemable, truly. Everything I did came in spite of your actions. I stand here as a survivor of you, not a son. Your physical abuse and mental abuse was awful. 

Reggie
To this day I’m afraid of yelling and the kick back of cars. The slamming of doors and the friendly pat on the back. And despite that, I needed you. Now don’t get me wrong, when you left for good and let Tim come into my life I rejoiced. I literally said hurrah to Tim. Like you were some awful cold or monster that was gone.  And yet you were there for the rest of my siblings. That, well it was hurtful. They all got toys and full bellies, they never slept hearing you call my mother a whore and a bitch. You changed and became a better man and I never saw it. You stayed that way for my life and will stay that way. So I guess goodbye, I really hope you felt bad, at least as bad as I did.

Then Gorgina spoke next. 

Gorgina 
When I was six you told me that you would make sure I was a protected princess. I believed you and on paper you kept your promise. We went to disney every summer. The park every week. I saw my friends more than my own brother. I never knew hunger or fear even. You were always a dad, why would you hit or yell? Now that’s on paper.


Gorgina 
You were great for big moments, but the small things? When I was made fun of for liking dolls? Mom helped. When that boy called me ugly and embarrassed me? Mom. When I broke my leg you didn’t once visit to watch a movie with me, or do my hair. You weren't there,  just a guy with big moments. But you missed a million little moments. And it's so hard to complain, I mean you made sure I got a tutor and played a sport. I got to attend a great college for free. You were there completely materially and that was it.

Gorgina 
Was I broken? Was I not worth talking to? Not a day you could have just listened? So I guess thanks for the things. I just wish you could have been my friend.

And finally, Jarven spoke.

Jarven
You did so much for me. You drove a total of three thousand miles to bail me out. Or to get me out of an infectious relationships with the next drug-addled woman that used me. Or even when I was the user. You didn’t care, you’d check me into rehab and call me and visit every chance you could. I don’t think you ever missed a meeting. Nine times in fifteen years you did that, not once did you yell at me. You know what you did when you heard I wanted to be a nurse? After all the times I’ve stolen from you? Or crashed your car? You paid for everything without thinking. Not even a judgemental look. Just a look of a man who had pure love for his son.

Jarven
In my childhood you were my friend more than a father. I knew everything about you. Summers were filled with fishing and hunting. Winters, skiing and hockey. You weren't just fun, you were there for everything. When I had my first break up or when I failed 8th grade, then ninth grade and when I got my GED. You were there with a cake and a balloon, we stopped at Mcdonalds and you just teared up and said how proud you were that his addict son got his GED at twenty-six. You were a good man to me with a terrible past. I can’t hate you even after hearing your abuses as much as I want to. I wish I could, but I owe you my life many times over the limit you should. So I love you dad. I hope it's pretty where you are.

The siblings sat in silence, the cold nipping at them with each breath. They all took turns burning their letters to their dad; with the cheap gas station lighter they found on the way. Its hello kitty pink exterior, producing a little flame to lay the man to rest.

After one last look at the grave, they all left. All now ready to move on from his presence.

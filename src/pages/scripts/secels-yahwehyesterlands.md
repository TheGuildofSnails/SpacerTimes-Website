# The Secels: Yahweh Yesterlands

**NARRATOR:**
Noah sat on the back of the stallion in the middle of the night. The untouched land was a surprise to him, he’s never seen so much dirt at home. Sarge, his mission leader, was slowly trotting along the path.

**NOAH:**
Food aid?

**SARGE:**
Yep.

**NOAH:**
I’ve never seen someone protect food aid with guns before.

**SARGE:**
Then you haven’t been ‘round these parts. The black market around here is willing to do a lot more than break into a warehouse to get something to sell.

**NOAH:**
Why though? We’re in the middle of now where. I don’t know many black market vendors willing to go this far for rice and beans.

**SARGE:**
People that need it, and they’re willing to pay for it.  Would you rather they have to give up their paychecks for that free meal?

**NOAH:**
I’m just saying, in all my mission work, this is a first.

**SARGE:**
Well, welcome to the Lord's land. 

**NARRATOR:**
They continued on the path in silence, only stopping when two peasants were dragging large sacks across the path. Trailing off the men spied that the sacks had a trail of blood.

**SARGE:**
Just pig farmers I’d reckon.

**NOAH:**
(whispering) Never seen six foot pigs before.

**NARRATOR:**
 They waited for the men to leave with the mystery sacks before continuing on. 

**NOAH:**
You don’t think that they had bodies in those sacks?

**SARGE:**
I don’t know, all I do know is that it’s not our business.

**NOAH:**
You're not the one that has to stay overnight in these woods. I’d think it is my business.

**SARGE:**
Calm down okay? I only need you here for one night. After that, you're free to continue with that hippie.

**NOAH:**
That hippie is doing real work here. I just don’t think I’m best utilized in keeping black market types away from their merchandise.

**SARGE:**
One night okay, morals and ethics can be talked about later.

**NARRATOR:**
The men kept an eye out for more strange sights. After some tense moments, they reached the warehouse. 

**SARGE:**
A beaut huh? We can feed an entire town for weeks of this baby.

**NOAH:**
Yeah, are you sure I’m safe? I’ve been in some war zones, and I’m getting the same feeling here.

**SARGE:**
Come on, for all we know it was kids stealing some pigs. You're just getting spooked, that's all. It’s all right these are foreign lands.

**NOAH:**
Just come back quick okay?

**SARGE:**
Seven hours that's it.

**NOAH:**
Seven hours, okay.

**NARRATOR:**
Sarge left on his horse. Noah checked his gun before beginning his patrol around the warehouse. He continued for hours in boredom, until he saw a teen girl sitting on the ground at the front of the warehouse. She was dirty with cracked lips. He calmly walked to her making sure to check around for an ambush. 

**NOAH:**
Ma’am, I have to ask you to leave. If you need Christian aid we have a clinic and a food bank in Ine's town about three miles West.

**SANSA:**
You shouldn’t be here.

**NOAH:**
Excuse me?

**SANSA:**
I saw you from that tower there, you see it.

**NARRATOR:**
She pointed to a broken down castle miles west. Her tower had a clear sight of many miles of forest. She wasn’t lying about her seeing him.

**NOAH:**
Look, like I said I don’t have aid for you. We have shelters in town if you need housing, it's just a couple miles west.

**SANSA:**
You're funny you know? You're like a deer before getting hunted.

**NOAH:**
I’m sorry, are you threatening me?

**SANSA:**
You don’t know, do you? Us peasants have done a couple of.. workings around the kingdom.

**NARRATOR:**
She got up from the ground mindlessly spinning around. Noah looked at her confused. 

**SANSA:**
We strung up Lordvunhouse and we’re looking at stringing up all of your types too. Invaders with big scary guns. Big scary men with silly ideas of civilization through hurting us, locals.

**NARRATOR:**
Noah gave a little chuckle.

**NOAH:**
That’s cute. This is not my first mission, okay? You can stop this, _prank _now. 

**SANSA:**
Okayyyyy, check for smoke when the sun comes up. Then the hunt really begins.

**NARRATOR:**
She twirled around down the hill. 

**NOAH:**
What a strange creature.

**NARRATOR:**
Time passed some more with Noah getting bored once more. As his shift came to an end he could see the sunrise. No smoke. Sighing in relief he waited for Sarge to appear. After a couple more hours in bright daylight, he never did. Noah began to get scared looking around for those revolting peasants the girl talked about. In his nervousness, he could see her in her tower waving at him. She held medals from executed Judges and other figures, sewing a cape from it. From her tower, she screamed out to him.

**SANSA:**
You'rrrre next!

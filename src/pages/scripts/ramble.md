# Ramble

**CATHERINE:**
Doctor, will I ever be normal?

**REIN:**
Hopefully this treatment will do that.

**CATHERINE:**
I do so wish for better days.

**REIN:**
I see you’ve been reading my recommendation list.

**CATHERINE:**
Yes, it's very good. Sometimes I feel like you know my soul doctor

**REIN:**
You know Catherine, you can call me Rein. 

**CATHERINE:**
That wouldn’t be very professional doctor, males should be addressed by their titles.  

**REIN:**
Well Catherine can we break the rules just once? 

**CATHERINE:**
No. 

**REIN:**
Okay Catherine if you insist, let's start the treatment. 

**NARRATOR:**
Catherine sat down in her chair. Two Guards helped strap her arms down. One of the guards stuck a syringe in her neck. Almost Immediately her arms tried to move. She began to scream. 

**CATHERINE:**
YOU BASTARD! HOW COULD YOU! 

**NARRATOR:**
Her nails were being whittled against the steel. Her tongue would get bitten off if not for one of the guards putting a gag over her mouth. 

**CATHERINE:**
You lied! Lied! 

**NARRATOR:**
She repeated this for some time. Rein waited till she was slumped before telling the guards to loosen her straps once more. They slipped on a pair of ballet shoes for her before leaving the room. 

**REIN:**
How about we play something nice?

**NARRATOR:**
Classical music played from the speakers. Catherine woke up from her state, wordlessly she smiled at Rein. She stood from her chair and began to dance ballet. 

**REIN:**
I miss this, this us. I wish you could know how special you are.

**NARRATOR:**
Catherine spun herself around flawlessly smiling at Rein.  

**REIN:**
You remember when I found you? You were a child, not even three when your mom gave you to me and Venisa. You were talented back then, you would spin when I’d play classic just like now. From there I knew you would be so talented.

**NARRATOR:**
Her posture is perfect with her foot work maintaining full standards. A smile stayed on her face, with ballet that comes from fine tuning your very being. Rein watched in wonder. In his head he was watching Catherine follow her timing, her cadence showing one of the best of the ancient art. Soon though she slowed, the drugs turning her star crossed dancing into a fight to stand up. With Catherine losing, collapsing against the wall. 

**REIN:**
I’m sorry Catherine. 

**NARRATOR:**
Her head dropped and turned to the one sided glass. 

**CATHERINE:**
You lied, you didn’t meet me before three. I was twelve, just a talent to you.

**REIN:**
Ballet isn’t just talent, it's life. All of western culture comes from it.

**CATHERINE:**
And was it worth my life? 

**REIN:**
It saved you, your skill brought you to the tops of history.

**CATHERINE:**
You mean you being at the top of history? Holding on to my greatness like a rat, just a filthy rat.

**REIN:**
Catherine, what did they teach you in that compound? 

**CATHERINE:**
They freed me, You used me. I was always your meal ticket. A meal ticket you hate, I mean you just hate me. You never liked that I didn’t need to be great. I don’t need to be remembered, like you.

**REIN:**
What do you do with your life without ballet? Just be some housewife like the rest of your sex?

**CATHERINE:**
Oh Rein, don’t pretend like I wasn’t much different than those housewives. You would parade me around all your fancy friends, critics, really anyone who’d watch. You could finally find someone to play out your fantasy of being a good teacher. You never were though were you? That’s the worst of it, you couldn’t even teach well. 

**REIN:**
Catherine, you don’t mean that.

**CATHERINE:**
I do Rein, admit it I was your lucky break. A break you screamed at and hit. Remember when I was fifteen? You threw me out of the studio window, I had so much blood on my uniform. Not that you cared, I think you went away to go cheat on your wife some more.

**REIN:**
Catherine, stop! 

**CATHERINE:**
Why, what's the worst you could do? I’m already stuck in your house, what more could you do! A stronger man, not you Rein, They would of let this obsession go years ago. Don’t you get it Rein? You’ll never be anything. You won’t even be a successful torturer! Or teacher or-” 

**REIN:**
Just be quiet!

**NARRATOR:**
The one sided glass burst open, Rein’s chair flung to the other side of the cell. A sizable glass shard landed neatly near Catherein. 

**REIN:**
Catherine I need you, I need you to dance, that's all I have left, please!

**NARRATOR:**
Rein dropped out of the hole heaving. His body barely letting him turn his head to Catherine. 

**REIN:**
I need you. Ballet needs you. 

**CATHERINE:**
Oh Rein you’ve aged. I would dance for you, but it seems unfortunately I’ve been in a terrible accident. 

**NARRATOR:**
She lifted the glass shard nice and high Rein to see. 

**REIN:**
Cathrine, no!

**NARRATOR:**
She began slicing the glass shard in her right leg. Tearing out her muscles, slicing the soles of her feet. Her arteries ripped and pulled from their resting place. The blood began to pour all over the floor and walls. Rein darted to her, quickly putting her in a choke hold. Holding her right hand to her peak. 


**REIN:**
[demanding]
Guards! Get medical! Now!

**CATHERINE:**
Am I ruined yet? 

**NARRATOR:**
Rein knocked the glass out her hand before laying her now limped body on the ground. He took off his jacket to tie up to her bleeding leg. 

**CATHERINE:**
I asked you a question, Rein. 

**REIN:**
Just please hang on, we can make you better. 

**CATHERINE:**
Join me. 

**NARRATOR:**
Her newly opened aterites didn’t give her a chance. She wasn't going to make it.

**REIN:**
I’m going to make you better okay? You hear me Catherine? 

**NARRATOR:**
Rein stood up after some time. It could have been hours for all he knew. His pants were soaked in her blood. The bits of crust flaked off as he moved around the room just staring at her corpse. 

**REIN:**
They will pay, okay Catherine? I’ll make sure every last one of those rebels that took you away from me pays. Catherine know, they, they did this to you. [yelling] Those animals! [soft, hurt] I will make sure they are put down. 

**NARRATOR:**
He left the room, allowing the guards to bury her body. Rein calmly still in his blood soaked clothes began to make a phone call.

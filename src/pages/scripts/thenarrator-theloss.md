# The Narrator: The Loss
##### Wrote by Nathanael Lipidarov

**APRIL:** I wish this all could end.

**NARRATOR:** This is April, she has been through a lot in her life.

**APRIL:** Even my birth was cursed, my life was a disaster from the very beginning…

**NARRATOR:** When April turned 2 her Father realized that she would be better off in a place where more people could care for her.

**APRIL:** Ha- My Father didn’t even want me, I had to go to that horrible place… \
 \
**NARRATOR:** As April began to grow up she was constantly bullied for her looks, she looked exactly like her mother, she had long curly red hair, and her face was covered in freckles. 

**APRIL:** Should have just ended it when those kids wouldn't stop.

**NARRATOR:** Due to the effects of the drugs, April became very frail, and the effects showed so much that the caretakers eventually didn't allow her to leave the orphanage, she was forced to do nothing but school, eat, and sleep.

**APRIL:** ha- yeah... Kind of glad the caretakers stopped me from going out, it stopped my drug habits and I got a little more meat on my bone.

**NARRATOR:** When April moved out of the orphanage she found a lot of work in the town, she took as many jobs as she could. Eventually, she lost all but one, the one she still works at to this day. Benson and Benson’s Bakery.

**APRIL:** Yep! The Bensons are great.

**NARRATOR:** But what April does not know is that the Bensons have just gotten into a horrible accident involving a gas leak in their home. Neither of them made it out alive. 

**APRIL:** Wait.. What? Who-

**NARRATOR:** April has yet to find out that she has lost her job and any means of obtaining a new one. As she has been fired from all the other businesses in the town.

**APRIL:** WHAT?! How is this- _who are you_!?

**NARRATOR:** Ah~ it seems you have finally noticed me, it must mean this story is coming to a close. \
 \
**APRIL:** _Close_?! _Story_?!

**NARRATOR:** Don’t worry April, I am the _Narrator._ My job is to shape the way a story progresses.

**APRIL:** So, what it’s _your_ fault my life has been horrible?

**NARRATOR:** Well- Yes, but that is the way of the story, and this one has gone on for much too long.  \
 \
**APRIL:** Why do you get to decide _my_ life? Why do I not get to narrate _my_ story, what if I wanted to change it?

**NARRATOR:** April, that is _very_ dangerous, you do not want to play with the story. \
 \
**APRIL:** Let me find that out _myself_.

**NARRATOR:** I warned you.** \
 \
APRIL:** Then April began to rise again, she fought all her life and was tired of following the story. She wanted to set a new life for herself. She met the Narrator on his plane of existence. And there they stood at the same height, level being to another.

**NARRATOR:** Fine… If this is how you plan to continue then I will join. In the empty white plane, it was like a void. There was no up, no down, no left, nor right. It always feels like you are _falling_ never _stopping_, movement is _freeing_ and you feel like you can _fly_.

**APRIL:** BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH

**NARRATOR:** BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH

**APRIL:** BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH 

**NARRATOR:** When April launched herself she flew within an inch of the Narrator’s face but was stopped by a force of some kind. It didn’t feel like a wall but almost like her own body stopped her. She began to realize the severity of the situation she was in as she was stuck.

**APRIL:** April began pushing as hard as she could to attack the Narrator. She pushed with all her might and she began to move, the force from her was so strong that the air around them began to push itself away. April broke free and hit the Narrator in the face. His face crunching from the attack.

**NARRATOR:** ARGH! That hurt! \
 \
**APRIL:** April began charging in for another attack.

**NARRATOR:** WAIT! This is _wrong!_ This is not how this story is supposed to unfold. Something has changed. No, no, nonononono. This cant be happening.  \
 \
**APRIL:** What is going on? \


**NARRATOR:** THEY CHANGED THE STORY!

**APRIL:** Who!? \
 \
**NARRATOR:** THEM! The beings from the outside. The ones listening to this story unfold, I was supposed to dodge that hit _thats_ how _I_ wrote it! _THATS_ what is supposed to happen. \
 \
**APRIL:** I am confused. What is going on? \
 \
**NARRATOR:** Let me explain how this works, I create a story. If _THEY_ like that story then the ending plays out how I designed it too, but they can change that ending if they do not approve of it. \
 \
**APRIL:** Are you saying that I was supposed to loose?! That no matter what I did, I would always loose?!

**NARRATOR:** Well that was how it was supposed to be! But it seems _THEY_ wanted a different ending. \
 \
**APRIL:** Why is it that _EVERYONE_ else _ALWAYS_ chooses _MY_ story! Why can’t I choose how _MY_ story goes! AHHHH!!! \
 \
**NARRATOR:** April, lets, uhm. Not get too hasty now. I-I don’t know how this ends anymore. \
 \
**APRIL:** April begins charging at the narrator again, screaming from the rage of the people who think they control her. She smashed the narrators face in the same spot as before. Destroying his right eye.  \
 \
**NARRATOR:** A-april, can’t we just come to an agreement? Can’t we just live in peace? Please?!

**APRIL:** NEVER! You took that from me a _LONG_ time ago! 

**NARRATOR:** Fine! But I am not going down without a fight. The Narrator begins charging at April, the force of his speed creating a sonic boom. He hit April in the stomach crushing her left lung.

**APRIL:** *Huff-* *Huff-* April takes a deep breath. This would be her final attack. She mustered up all the power in her and grabbed hold of the Narrators head. She began _smashing_ his head into itself, the cracks and crushing could be heard echoing through the void. She left him alive to say one last thing.

**NARRATOR:** I-I guess its the end of the story now. G-good luck, April. \
 \
**APRIL:** That may have been the end of your story, but mine? Mine has just begun.

[long pause]

**APRIL:** But first, lets get rid of these peeping eyes, I guess its time for you to go find another story, because this one has reached, THE END…

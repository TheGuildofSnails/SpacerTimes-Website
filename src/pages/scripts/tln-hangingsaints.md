# The Lords Nation: Hanging Saints

**NARRATOR:**
Lordvouse walked into the dark cave, the cave of the hanging saints. Children dressed in the skins of deers guided him to the room of enlightenment. His bare steps on cave floors flooding the empty halls. A frail child taking his hands to lead him to the cage. The room softly lit by a small fire he could see the children’s eyes sewn over with deer tendons. He hid his fear before entering the cramped cage. Inside sat the head of a deer, a child whispered in a raspy tone.

**CHILD:**
(raspy) Thine saints will show its purpose.

**NARRATOR:**
The cage rose in a jerk. His world swirling as the cage rose to darker heights. He rose till he heard the rattling of chains, his cage easing into the sounds of ringing. He stood there a moment till through the cut out eyes he saw a man who looked like a corpse. His skin aged and black, his eyes long fallen out. With withered lips the man began to speak. 

**SAINT:**
Why do you seek?

**LORDVOUSE:**
(delayed response) My kingdom, we are to lose to my enemies.

**SAINT:**
The gates close in oh foolish man, why do you fight it?

**LORDVOUSE:**
I wish for my children to grow up in peace.

**SAINT:**
A noble goal, are you a nobleman?

**LORDVOUSE:**
I am.

**SAINT:**
Why come to us then?

**LORDVOUSE:**
I heard you have answers. Ways to save his life.

**SAINT:**
Do you know if these means are for holy men?

**LORDVOUSE:**
I have heard they are not.

**SAINT:**
Do you know what happens with these powers?

**LORDVOUSE:**
I do.

**SAINT:**
Then you know you must become one of us then.

**NARRATOR:**
[chain shaking and metal clanging] The cages shook. 

**SAINT:**
You must no longer know your own, be damned for eternity!

**LORDVOUSE:**
I’ll do what I must.

**SAINT:**
In your cage sits a dagger, if you so wish to give your kingdom freedom, slice your wrist. Place your hand through the cage, and let your blood drip upon my flesh.

**NARRATOR:**
Fearfully Lordvouse slit his wrist. Pushing his hand through the bar he bled unto the hanging saint. [brid screeching] A great scream could be heard from the saint. [bones breaking] Wings began ripping from his flesh, [slicing and dragging] claws grew from his withered hands. From a corpse he became a demon, [flapping and cage breaking] terrifyingly flying in the sky he ripped Lordvouse from his cage. [burning/scorching and dust flutter] Taking the head of the deer he seared it on to his skin before becoming dust. [dirt impact and bone break] Lordvouse fell to the ground, the impact breaking his bones. [fusing] In the moon's light slowly the deer’s flesh became his flesh. His wounds healing. By the the time day broke he was a beast. Standing tall he had bone fragments showing from his ripped skin. No longer human. A voice stood in his head. 

**SAINT:**
Go, save your kingdom. For you do not have long.

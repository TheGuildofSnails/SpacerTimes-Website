NARRATOR
In 2041 the human race launched itself into the stars. This joint effort from China and America has led to thousands of space colonies to be born far from home, to many these days Earth is just another planet. In that year future founders of the stars were interviewed the day of that historic launch with one question. In one thousand years what do you want humanity to remember about you? Today we are proud to show you these relics of history, brought to you by Spacer Times. 

INTERVIEWER
Ma’am! Ma’am! One question one question!

SORNA
What do you want?

INTERVIEWER
One question ma’am before you board. 

SORNA
Quick kid, quick. 

INTERVIEWER
In one thousand years what do you want the people of the stars to know?

SORNA
(Scoff) Don’t ever gamble. Not with your money anyway. Safe bets make secure futures.You get a big talker saying he knows a risky option that will make you riches? Liar, do not trust them. Hookers, war, and drugs that's what you put your money in. Ten thousand years from now we’re gonna have drugged up hookers with guns, there’s your answer kid. 

INTERVIEWER
Oh, um, thank you?

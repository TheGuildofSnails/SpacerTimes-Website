# Run!
##### Wrote by Donna Lipidarov

(feet running, then fades) Just a mile to my house about 45 mins of walking on this cold, windy, rainy day. (Wind & rain sound)

Just one more block to go to warm up.

Even with the sound of rain hitting me face-on, I felt that I was being followed by someone. As I turned around to find the culprit there was a hard tug on my right arm. I screamed; Get off me! Let me go! HELP!.. HELP! As he was pulling me toward a city building. My screams couldn't get any louder as the cold was getting to my throat, I finally lost my voice to a low whisper.  I saw the daily mailman down the way, I thought to myself, can he see me? If so can he tell that this stranger was taking me against my will? Oh, an older woman whoâ€™s coming back from buying groceries. I tried to get her attention to no avail. The doors to this huge city building are overwhelming me. We enter the elevator to the 9th floor. The feeling of sickness any moment now will help me. (Puke sound) 

I thought to myself, Oh no! I got it on his pants and shoes! He took two steps back and I pulled my arm with such force that it felt like I left my arm in his hands! The blood is rushing in my head as I ran to the stairs. As I ran down the stairs two steps at a time trying to get away. Hearing footsteps coming down the stairs is getting closer to me. RUN, just RUN I kept telling myself until I reached the 4th floor. Noooooo my boot got stuck on the bottom of the banister. The footsteps are getting closer & closer. I'm running at the same time I'm trying to put my boot on. Done!

I lost a good deal of time getting my boot on. As I ran two steps at a time he was doing double that! It's over, he pulled me down by the back of my coat hitting my head on an exit door. I'm starting to get dizzy as I looked up at him staring down at me. I yelled GET AWAY FROM ME! Then, the door opened from the inside. Leaning on the wall I'm looking at the door with anxiety. Who could it be? Yes! It's the building supervisor. We both stared at him as he tore down the stairs. I followed him. He's not getting away with this. My arm was hurting & my head feels like it would explode as I ran & ran & ran right into my momma's arms. I was home.

# Stay House

**NARRATOR:**
Stay House, opened in 1947 its original founder, Staver Houstin was given the task of rehabilitating rogue women. Despite their many years open, not much is known how they do so. The employees often stay for life and are ferociously loyal. The critics of Stay House accuse them of cult-like behavior to get these women back to society's standards. Of course this is denied by the head doctor. They always claim their methods are completely based on science and facts. They even say they won't use hypnosis since it can produce religious feelings. Not that it quells any of the activists' protests. 

**NARRATOR:**
So In 1963 two women pretended to go insane, and entered the Stay House. This is the only audio not found and burnt by the government propaganda team. Unfortunately this audio has been altered by the rebels to protect the women's identities. 

**DOCTOR:**
Listen REDACTED we’re going to start a course of pseudopylin.

**UNKNOWN:**
What does that mean doctor? 

**DOCTOR:**
Pseudopylin will “soften” your mind. Right now you have a crazed look at the world. The stress and lack of good genes doesn’t do you any favors. So pseudopylin will break down any “fight” or learned behavior in your brain. From there we can instill good values and behaviors instead. 

**UNKNOWN:**
Doctor I don’t want to be changed, I’m sane you’ve seen the test scores I’m beating the intelligence tests. Isn’t there any other treatment?

**DOCTOR:**
I wish, I won't lie to you, this treatment will be intense. Many of the women tell us it increases their stress for the first few weeks. They gain weight, and inflict self harm, feels like someone else controls their bodies. But this treatment also has the highest completion rate, so I think REDACTED it might be the best option. 

**UNKNOWN:**
DOCTOR! Haven’t I shown enough improvement to keep on my current treatment? 
	
**DOCTOR:**
Well REDACTED me and the team don’t think so. Just last week it was noted you scoffed when it was mentioned that you may be remarried after being cured. And the week before you told another patient that you were proud that the rebels bombed council member-

**UNKNOWN:**
Snitch. Was it REDACTED? I bet you it was REDACTED!

**DOCTOR:**
I can’t tell you, what matters is you’ve had four incidents so far telling the team you're simply not improving. 

**UNKNOWN:**
Can’t a girl have her own opinion doctor? I mean how many of the men you captured have my same thoughts, what makes them different?

**DOCTOR:**
Well first off you're not a girl, you're thirty one RETACTED. Second, it's scientifically proven women can be more influenced than men. And RETACTED if I could be honest for a second the men you speak of are dead or they work in the coal mine. Twelve hour days of hard labor with rice gruel every night for every meal. Compared to a shot and some group activity I’d be grateful. 

**UNKNOWN:**
Doctor, you're saying I should be grateful you're going to drug me into being complacent? That doesn’t sound too much different from the coal mines. We both are being forced to suffer for our objections to the state. 

**DOCTOR:**
And like a parrot you repeated something you were taught. REDACTED you know scientifically the best place for a woman is the home. The birth of a child balances a woman's brain and hormones. Marriage allows a man to be stabilized and the woman to be led. This is the simple truth REDACTED. The state wants you to live the best life you can REDACTED so please let us. 

**UNKNOWN:**
I don’t think I have much choice in it. Doctor you have to see how wrong this is? Drugging and mind controlling someone to fit your mold is, well it's evil. 

**DOCTOR:**
Well REDACTED we’ll see, I think in the years to come you’ll thank us for getting you into a better spot. When that day comes, the staff likes carmels. 

**NARRATOR:**
The two unknown women took a plea deal and were sent to Canada in return for the original tapes. There are rumors more of the audio survived. Yet today besides this heavily edited audio we’ve yet to see.

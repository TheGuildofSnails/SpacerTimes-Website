# The Secels: Decandence Unto War

**NARRATOR:**
[croud sounds come in] Holy day welcomed festivities. The streets filled with Christians all singing hymns. Flyers and noise makers littered the street. Vendors could be seen selling figurines of Jesus along with sealed cups of wine. Couples danced to the hymns saying beautiful things to one another. And the street preachers were singing praises, yelling out voices of promise, of love unto the crowd.  Mabe and her fellow gun merchants sat on the balconies watching all this Joy enjoying a juicy bison steak. A very pricey meat enjoyed by the wealthiest. Mabe just became one tonight, having just sold three boats worth of guns. Tonight was a night of celebration, one that was brought down by Judah, who was flipping stalls on his way to Mabe’s balcony. 

**JUDAH:**
(SCREAMING) Killers of babies!

**NARRATOR:**
[fork drop sound] Mabe dropped her fork, looking at Judah in confusion.

**JUDAH:**
(SCREAMING) Makers of war! The fires of hell wait for you! They wait for you!

**NARRATOR:**
[whooshes] Mabe looked around for the guards.

**MABE:**
Sir? Are you okay?

**JUDAH:**
(SCREAMING) The Lord showed me your face warmonger! And you were _burning_! You were in the pits with all the other warmongers!

**NARRATOR:**
[crowd moving and talking slows to stop] The crowds slowed at Judah, making a little circle around him. The street was now quiet save for Judah’s yelling.

**MABE:**
You're drunk old man! Go sleep it off alright?

**JUDAH:**
Blessed be the peacemakers said our Lord! The unfaithful are to be _burned_, says our lord! The prince of peace, our lord of lords had been _shamed_ by your actions. How much blood rests on your hands war monger?

**NARRATOR:**
Mabe could see the crowd was waiting for a response. She had to act quickly before she was the new word of gossip around town. 

**MABE:**
Sir, the weapons I sell are made to protect us. Our state now has plenty of money to feed the poor, to help the sick. I am an honest woman, I paid my fair share faithfully. You shouldn’t have a problem with that sir. I remember a verse or two that says we should help the poor and the sick I believe.

**JUDAH:**
Oh, warmonger! Why do you twist the way of the word of life? You do not protect us with your war, oh warmonger! The false lords by the name of Relinhouse, Bornhouse, and Callhouse, you have sold too, they all Plan to use these weapons of war to kill thousands. To Pillage, destroy, and conquer! What say you warmonger? What have your defense be?

**MABE:**
Oh Judah, what is this game? Are donations low this month? Should we also rebuke the great men and women who produce these _nasty_ guns? What about those that work on the ships? Where is your big speech for them? Judah, this act you play is not cute. It’s profane and odd. I am a Christian just as much as you, you know this. Please leave before you embarrass yourself. 

**NARRATOR:**
Judah took a moment to stare at Mabe. Putting on a smile he responded. 

**JUDAH:**
Jehovah trieth the righteous one; but the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul hateth.

**NARRATOR:**
With that Judah melted in the crowd. Within a few minutes the crowds went back to celebration. Some in the crowd looked at Mabe judgmentally, and others showed pity. Mabe went back to her meal unsure of how to feel.

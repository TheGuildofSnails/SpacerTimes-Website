# A readers story - Napoleon
##### Wrote by Ethan Skinner

**NARRATOR:** 12th, February, 1819-

Dear mother, I sit here stuck in some sort of fear I never thought I could have. One that has allowed an intruder in my mind. It asks me late at night about something that has consumed me in everything, legacy.  \
 \
It asks me how I should be seen long after my leaving, how they might view everything I’ve done. In my short life, I fear, I know what happens to a lifetime of conquering, changing history. It stretches and wanes with time. Victories become story, story becomes fact, fact becomes static, lifeless. How is it that my life can become nothing more than “history”? After all I have done? I am cursed to be flattened by time, humanity stolen. All I, a mighty leader, changer of history can do is watch. I love you mother, pray for your son, for he is mortal and terrified.

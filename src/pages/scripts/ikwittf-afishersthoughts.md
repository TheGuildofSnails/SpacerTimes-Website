# I Know What It Takes To Fly: A Fishers Thoughts

**NARRATOR:**
The mountain wasn’t made for human life. That was clear from its hard surface and its nearly infertile soil. The winters were almost impossibly cold and the summer months never gave us much heat. 

**ZERA:**
[whispering] Hey, wake up.

**NARRATOR:**
James pulled his cover over his face in defiance of his mom’s words. 

**ZERA:**
[whispered again] Come on mister we got fish to catch. 

**NARRATOR:**
James gave a long sigh before throwing his straw pillow at his mother. 

**JAMES:**
I’m doing this unwillingly!

**ZERA:**
At least you're doing it.

**NARRATOR:**
She swiftly tossed the pillow back at his face. Breakfast this morning was grebes meat roasted over a fire with pan-fried bread as a side. 

**JAMES:**
I don’t see why I have to do school, it's not like I’ll do anything different than you.

**ZERA:**
Whoa! Those are some big ideas on such an empty stomach.

**JAMES:**
I’m just saying…

**ZERA:**
Well, say it with some breakfast first. 

**NARRATOR:**
James' hunger forced him to give up some pride. 

**JAMES:**
Alright, I guess so.

**NARRATOR:**
Zera handed James his bread and fish before joining him at the table. She waited for him to take a few bites of food before speaking.

**ZERA:**
So what's this about school? It sounds like you're feeling a bit gloomy about it. 

**JAMES:**
I’m thirteen you don’t need to use baby words.

**ZERA:**
So suddenly you don’t have feelings at thirteen? Okay, fine. What makes you feel so dismal then?

**JAMES:**
Huh? 

**NARRATOR:**
Zera just winked at him. She let him chew on the word while she had a couple bites of bread. 

**JAMES:**
I’m just gonna be a fisher like you. You heard the radio, that the water isn’t going down any time soon. There’s no need for smart people.

**ZERA:**
Well, that may be true, knowing how to read would be nice, right? Maybe you could start writing down the old world in grandpa’s stories. Or even make up a new way to fish?

**JAMES:**
Or maybe you could just give me a ship. I already do all the work! You’ve seen me work a net, I catch more than anyone!

**ZERA:**
And that's why you're going to school. Your smart, and smart people need something more than fishing.

**NARRATOR:**
James shrugged his shoulders. 

**JAMES:**
[whisper] You're smart to Mom, jeez.

**NARRATOR:**
Zera smiled, not wanting to point out how much James blushed at showing his mom a hint that he loved her. 

**ZERA:**
Well then, what do you say you do school on the ship today? It's only the first day so there's no harm in it.

**JAMES:**
Will the radio even work at that high?

**ZERA:**
You could always stay here, there’s plenty of chores.

**JAMES:**
No! I’ll get the radio.

**ZERA:**
And your chalkboard.

**JAMES:**
And the chalkboard.

**NARRATOR:**
They both ate in silence for the rest of breakfast. James failingly tried to hide a smile. When they hopped on the hot air balloon James tucked the portable ham radio in his pocket. Determined to not drop it. The flames licked the leather balloons and they began to rise. 

**NARRATOR:**
When the rope snapped back, telling the duo that the hot air balloon will go no higher. They got the nets ready, throwing them across the sky. Their bearings made groans of pain as they got pulled by the wind.

**JAMES:**
We should visit dad soon.

**ZERA:**
Yeah we should. He hasn’t come around in a while, has he?

**JAMES:**
And the talks stopped too.

**ZERA:**
Well, the scrapping has been a bit more busy for him. I’m sure he’ll talk when he can slow down.

**JAMES:**
I just wish he could be here. I bet he’s forgotten my face.

**ZERA:**
Maybe so.

**JAMES:**
Mom!

**NARRATOR:**
James looked at her holding back tears. His farce adult mask slipped. Zera embraced him, making sure to squeeze him as much as her strength allowed. 

**ZERA:**
You know he loves you and your face. He would never forget it in a million years.

**JAMES:**
Yeah, yeah.

**NARRATOR:**
James was unable to speak more without crying into his Mom’s hair. But the moment was broken when a grebe got caught in the balloon's outer net. 

**JAMES:**
Oh!

**NARRATOR:**
They rushed to pull up the net from its gravity trap. The grebe did not make the pull up easy,  with combined effort though, they brought it on board. Quickly Zera slashed its throat. Holding it over the edge to drain.

**ZERA:**
Y’know kid? Maybe you could invent a cleaner way to do this? Like a robot servant or a button?

**JAMES:**
That sounds like a fun Idea!

**ZERA:**
See school _is_ important.

**NARRATOR:**
The radio shook out the voice of the elderly teacher. James rushed to start his first day.
